Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has called on MPs to consider a fresh case for the RAF to attack the group known as Islamic State in Syria, as well as Iraq.
Mr Fallon suggested that Britain should rethink its position if the killing of British tourists in Tunisia last week can be linked to the group's Syrian headquarters.
