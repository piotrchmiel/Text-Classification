New York City reviewing contracts with Donald Trump, mayor says

NEW YORK New York City is reviewing its contracts with Donald Trump following comments by the developer and U.S. presidential candidate insulting Mexicans, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday.
"Trumpâ€™s comments do not represent the values of inclusion and openness that define us as New Yorkers," the mayor said in a statement.
