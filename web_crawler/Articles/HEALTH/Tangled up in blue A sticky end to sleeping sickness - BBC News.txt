Tangled up in blue: A sticky end to sleeping sickness - BBC News

The lure of a bright blue target is tempting a killer insect towards its own demise - thanks to scientists working in Uganda.
Up to 60 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are at risk of catching sleeping sickness which is caused by a parasite passed on by biting tsetse flies.
The symptoms include fatigue and swollen joints. Left untreated it is usually fatal.
But as Maryam Abdalla reports from Arua in northern Uganda, British researchers are hoping that their blue targets could spell the end of this deadly disease.
