#sunburnart trend warned against by dermatologists over cancer risk | Daily Mail Online

Always wear sunscreen.
It's a golden rule that some are breaking this summer for the sake of creating hot to the touch tattoo like art on their skin and posting an image to Instagram along with hashtag #sunburnart.
Dermatologists are firmly warning people to stay away from the trend they say could cause skin cancer.

In order to create the design, people apply sunburn or temporary tattoos to their skin then they let the surrounding area burn until it creates a design.
'This is where popular culture is clashing with medical advice,' said Dr. Barney Kenet, a New York-based dermatologist to ABC News.
'It’s really obvious that sunburn does two things to you: it gives you lines and freckles and wrinkles and it also causes skin cancer especially melanoma,' he added.
Kenet says that the sunburn art trend is even more dangerous than normal sunbathing because people may be tempted to stay in the sun longer in order to get a leaner burn.
'Then there’s the motivation for getting a good burn,' he explained.
'The practice is tempting them to burn even worse.'
According to Cancer.org, Melanoma will account for 73,000 cases of skin cancer this year.
Wearing sunscreen can prevent cancer and premature aging and promotes a longhealthy life. Why waste it?
