How to Be Smart About Sex With Hepatitis C


When you have hepatitis C, there’s a chance you can spread the disease during sex. So have an honest chat with your partner about it.
You can work together to have a safe love life. Here's how.

When William Yarbrough of North Carolina learned 14 years ago that he had hep C, he told his wife as soon as he got home from the doctor's office.
“My wife and I would be approaching this experience together, and since we have no secrets, the sooner I involved her, the better,” says Yarbrough, a member of the American Liver Foundation’s National Patient Advisory Committee.
If you've just gotten diagnosed, there’s a chance you’ve had the virus for years without knowing it. So suggest to your partner (and exes) that they get tested for it, too.
Some people don’t know how to bring up their disease to a partner, especially in a new relationship. If you need help, ask your doctor for advice.
“A good place to start is: 'So, I need to tell you something important,'” says Lynn Wang, MD, a sexuality counselor. "[You could say:] 'I hope this doesn’t affect our relationship, because I really care about you and respect you, and that’s why I'm letting you know this. I have hepatitis C.'”
Let your partner know the disease isn't spread through casual contact.
“[Some people] think they can get the virus from hugging, kissing, or sharing utensils,” says Lisa Richards, a hepatology nurse practitioner at the University of California, San Diego Medical Center. That’s not the case. It can only be spread through blood.
So to keep your partner safe, he or she needs to avoid contact with your blood. This may affect the way you have sex.
Some situations can lead to bleeding. Anal sex can cause trauma. So can rough or dry vaginal sex. And making love during a woman's period if she has hep C is also risky. In these cases, a latex condom can protect your partner.
