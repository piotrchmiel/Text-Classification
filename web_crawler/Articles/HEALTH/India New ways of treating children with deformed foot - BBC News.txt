India: New ways of treating children with deformed foot - BBC News

5 July 2015 Last updated at 09:47 BST
Clubfoot used to mean a life of unemployment and illiteracy for children born in developing countries - but now effective treatments mean they have a better chance at a full life.
The condition means that a child cannot put their foot flat on the floor - so in some cases they would not be able to go to school or play easily.
A treatment called the Ponseti method gently realigns the foot using surgery, plaster casts and a brace worn at night.
Suranjana Tewari has been to one clinic in Mumbai where they are about to test a new kind of low-cost brace.
