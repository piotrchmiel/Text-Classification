Trials of a gene therapy for cystic fibrosis suggest a new treatment could be made available within five years.
In the study, patients were given healthy genes to breathe in, to help correct the problem in their lungs.
Early results showed slight improvements, but scientists say more work is needed to make the treatment truly effective.
