Selenite wins Belmont feature on a disqualification

NEW YORK (AP) -- Selenite was elevated to the victory on a disqualification Wednesday in the $80,000 allowance feature for fillies and mares on the turf at Belmont Park.
Evidently was first under the wire after bumping even-money favorite Regardez in deep stretch. Following a video review, the stewards placed Evidently fifth.
The decision lifted Selenite, the 8-1 runner-up, into the win. The gray 4-year-old ridden by John Velazquez and trained by David Donk paid $18.20, $6.60 and $3.70.
It was her fourth win in 14 starts.
The time was 2:05.04 for the 1 1-4 miles on the course rated good.
In the revised order of finish, Fresh Feline was placed second, returning $5.80 and $4 return.
Agawa moved up from fourth to the show spot, paying $6.80.
