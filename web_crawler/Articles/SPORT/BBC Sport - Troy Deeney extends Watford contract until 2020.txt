BBC Sport - Troy Deeney extends Watford contract until 2020

Watford striker Troy Deeney has extended his contract with the club until 2020.
Deeney, 27, scored 21 times as the Hornets won automatic promotion to the Premier League last season.
Swansea City 
    
enquired about his availability in June 

     but Deeney has now extended his contract, which was due to expire next summer.
The ex-Walsall striker became Watford's first player to score 20 goals or more in three straight seasons last season.
His regular strike partner, Matej Vydra, 
    
completed a permanent move 

     to Watford from Udinese on Thursday.
The 23-year-old Czech - who had been on loan from Udinese - contributed 16 league goals in 2014-15.
The club's new manager Quique Sanchez Flores now has both key strikers tied to long-term deals as Watford prepare for their first top-flight appearance since 2007 when they face Everton on 8 August.
