Dedicated to Bob wins feature race at Monmouth Park

OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Drawing Away Stable's Dedicated to Bob took the lead in the middle of the stretch and scored a neck-length victory over Golden Story on Friday in the $40,000 allowance/optional claiming feature at Monmouth Park.
Ridden by Carlos Olivero, Dedicated to Bob covered the five furlongs on the turf in 55 3/5 seconds. The 5-year-old horse paid $6.20, $3.60 and $2.80 in winning for the fourth time in 19 career starts.
''It was a great move Carlos made early on in the race,'' winning trainer Jorge Navarro said. ''He sat back off the speed and gave us one good run. This horse never gives up and just continues to fight.''
Golden Story returned $4 and $2.60, and Snowday paid $3.20 to show.
