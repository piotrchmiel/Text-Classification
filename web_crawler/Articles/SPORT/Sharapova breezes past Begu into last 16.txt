Sharapova breezes past Begu into last 16

LONDON Fourth seed Maria Sharapova moved serenely into the Wimbledon fourth round with a 6-4 6-3 victory over Romanian Irina-Camelia Begu on Friday.
The 28-year-old Russian, champion at the All England Club in 2004, overpowered her 29th-seeded opponent on a sun-drenched Court One to take her place in the last 16.
Sharapova wasted a chance to close out the match when she served for victory at 5-1 in the second set but did not make the same mistake again and completed victory in one hour 23 minutes.
