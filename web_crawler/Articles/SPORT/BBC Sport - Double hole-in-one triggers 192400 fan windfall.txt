BBC Sport - Double hole-in-one triggers $192,400 fan windfall

Hundreds of lucky golf fans shared a $192,400 (£123,000) windfall after a double hole-in-one at the Greenbrier Classic in West Virginia, USA.
Americans George McNeill, 39 and Justin Thomas, 22 triggered the pay-out at the par-three 18th.
McNeill earned each spectator at the hole $100 (£64), with those there for Thomas's feat collecting $500 (£320).
A third will lead to a final $1,000 (£640) fan pay-day in the charity deal funded by course owner Jim Justice.
McNeill, who finished with a three-under 67 said: "I had a lot of new friends on 18. They were all thanking me as I walked off."
Thomas, also three-under, said: "It's really cool that Mr Justice does that. It just gives everyone more reason to come here and watch."
Tiger Woods carded a four-under-par 66, the former world number one's
