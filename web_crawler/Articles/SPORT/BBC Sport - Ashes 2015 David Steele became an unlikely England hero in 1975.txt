BBC Sport - Ashes 2015: David Steele became an unlikely England hero in 1975

To get a flavour of David Steele's shambolic introduction to Test cricket, type 'Spinal Tap lost backstage' into YouTube; substitute a bespectacled, grey-haired chap carrying a cricket bat for a heavy metal band wielding axes; savour the absurdity.
"When it was my turn to bat, I missed the Long Room, dropped down another flight of stairs and ended up outside the toilets," says Steele, who made his England debut against Australia at Lord's 40 years ago this month. "A chap on the door said: 'Probably best if you head back up.'
"Then when I finally made it down the pavilion steps, I could hear the comments from the members: 'Who's this grey-haired bleeder?'"
When Steele finally made it to the middle, the abuse continued. "Dennis Lillee said to me: 'Where the hell have you been, 
    
Groucho?'  

     I replied: 'I almost ended up in the toilets, Dennis. Do you mind going back over there and having a bowl?'"
Following a 4-1 drubbing the previous winter  

     and an innings defeat in the first Test at Edgbaston, the English public craved the intervention of a superhero. One wicket down in the second Test, out wandered 
    
Mr Magoo.
Pace duo Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson tore England apart down under in the 1974-75 Ashes series
