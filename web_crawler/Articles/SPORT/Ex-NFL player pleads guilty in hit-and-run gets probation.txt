Ex-NFL player pleads guilty in hit-and-run, gets probation

WRENTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Former Buffalo Bills and New England Patriots linebacker Brandon Spikes has pleaded guilty in a hit-and-run crash that injured three people and will serve a year of probation.
Spikes appeared Wednesday in court in Wrentham, Massachusetts, where he admitted negligent operation of a motor vehicle, leaving the scene of personal injury, operating an uninsured vehicle, speeding and a marked-lanes violation.
Defense attorney Christopher Belezos says Spikes wanted to take responsibility and move on with his life.
State police found Spikes' damaged Mercedes-Benz Maybach abandoned June 7 in the Interstate 495 median in Foxborough. At about the same time, police got a report a Nissan SUV had been struck from behind by a vehicle that left the scene. Three people were treated for minor injuries.
The Patriots cut Spikes afterward.
