O'Reilly signs $52.5 million, 7-year extension with Sabres

The Buffalo Sabres have made newly acquired forward Ryan O'Reilly their highest-paid player by signing him to a $52.5 million, seven-year contract extension on Friday.
The Sabres announced the signing, while a person familiar with discussions revealed the value of the contract to The Associated Press. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the Sabres did not disclose the monetary terms.
O'Reilly is regarded a top-line talent and had one year left on his contract, during which he is scheduled to make $6.2 million next season. He was acquired from Colorado in a trade that involved five players during the first round of the NHL draft June 26.
The Sabres also acquired forward Jamie McGinn, while giving up forward Mikhail Grigorenko, JT Compher, defenseman Nikita Zadorov and the 31st pick of the draft.
O'Reilly will get a chance to play alongside rookie center Jack Eichel, who was selected with the second pick in the draft. O'Reilly had 17 goals and 55 points in 80 games last season. He also led Avalanche forwards in averaging nearly 20 minutes of ice time.
The sixth-year player has 90 goals and 246 points in 427 career games.
The 24-year-old O'Reilly is a key fixture in a rebuilding process for a Sabres team that's coming off consecutive last-place finishes.
He will be part of a new-look team that added goaltender Robin Lehner in a trade last week. Forward Evander Kane is preparing to make his debut with the Sabres at the start of this season. Kane was acquired in a trade with the Winnipeg Jets in February, but missed the remainder of the season after having shoulder surgery.
