BBC Sport - National League fixtures: Tranmere start with home game with Woking

Tranmere will start their first season outside the Football League in 95 years with a home game against Woking in the National League on Saturday, 8 August.
Cheltenham, who were also relegated after a 16-year stay in the Football League, begin at Lincoln City .
Grimsby Town, beaten by Bristol Rovers in May's play-off final, are away at Kidderminster Harriers.
The new season is the first since the top flight of non-league was rebranded as the National League.
Promoted sides Barrow, Boreham Wood and Bromley host Dover, FC Halifax and Wrexham respectively, while Conference North play-off winners Guiseley start away at Welling.
Last season's beaten play-off semi-finalists Forest Green and Eastleigh start with trips to Altrincham and Southport respectively.
Elsewhere, Gateshead begin with a 307-mile trip to Aldershot while Torquay host Macclesfield and Braintree visit Chester.
Tranmere, relegated from the Football League for the first time in their history, and Cheltenham will be looking to emulate the efforts of Bristol Rovers who last season became the first side since Carlisle in 2005 to gain promotion straight back to the Football League.
