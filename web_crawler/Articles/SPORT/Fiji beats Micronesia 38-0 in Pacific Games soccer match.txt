Fiji beats Micronesia 38-0 in Pacific Games soccer match

PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) -- Pacific Games organizers say Fiji broke the record for the biggest win in international football with a 38-0 victory Sunday over the Federated States of Micronesia.
Fiji led 21-0 lead at halftime. Antonio Tuivuna scored 10 goals for Fiji, which like other teams in the event is being represented by an under-23 side.
Organizers said the result broke the 2001 record when Australia beat American Samoa 31-0 in an Oceania confederation qualifier for the 2002 World Cup, although it was not clear if the record would be recognized by FIFA because it involved an under-age tournament.
Micronesia lost its first match 30-0 to Tahiti.
The 15th Pacific Games, which end July 18, had its first full day of competition Sunday. There are 24 mostly Pacific Island countries competing.
