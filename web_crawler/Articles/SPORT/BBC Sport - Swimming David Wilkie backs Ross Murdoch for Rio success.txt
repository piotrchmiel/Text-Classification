BBC Sport - Swimming: David Wilkie backs Ross Murdoch for Rio success

Former Olympic champion David Wilkie is tipping fellow Scotsman Ross Murdoch to win a medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
But he thinks London 2012 silver medallist Michael Jamieson will find it tough to make the British team.
Murdoch beat hot favourite Jamieson to the 200m breaststroke gold at last year's Commonwealth Games 

     in Glasgow.
"I think it mentally destroyed Michael for a while and he had to go away and take stock and work out where he wants to be," said Wilkie.
"He's a class swimmer but he took a big mental hit," Wilkie added.
"He was the golden boy of the Games and I really think he thought he could just turn up, swim four lengths and they'd give him the gold medal.
"Sport is not like that; sport is cruel. And suddenly this young guy Ross Murdoch just turns up and beats him and he just couldn't handle that.
''I guess we just have to wait and see what happens.''
There was disappointment for both Murdoch, 21, and Jamieson, 26, at April's British Swimming Championships in London, with the former third and the latter sixth in the 200m breaststroke final.
Murdoch did, however, make the GB team for next month's World Championships after finishing second to a world record time from Adam Peaty in the 100m event.
