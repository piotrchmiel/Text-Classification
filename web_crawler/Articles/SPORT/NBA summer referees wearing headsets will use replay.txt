NBA summer referees wearing headsets, will use replay

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Referees in the NBA summer leagues will be wearing headsets and replay reviews will be used during games.
The policies were revealed Saturday when Miami and Indiana met in the first summer league game of the season. Referees will stay in touch with the help of earpieces and microphones.
Replays were used to check whether a foul was of the clear-path variety and in another instance to award Heat guard Josh Richardson what became a four-point play late in the third quarter of Miami's 92-76 win. Unlike the regular season, the NBA's replay center in Secaucus, New Jersey, will not be used.
The NBA says the policies will be applied in the Orlando, Utah and Las Vegas leagues.
