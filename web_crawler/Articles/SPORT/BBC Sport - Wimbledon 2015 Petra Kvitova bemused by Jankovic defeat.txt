Petra Kvitova says she is at a loss to explain 
    
the surprise third-round loss to 28th seed Jelena Jankovic 

     that ended her Wimbledon title defence.
The Czech, 25, was beaten 3-6 7-5 6-4 after dropping just three games in her previous two matches at the tournament.
"I'm not really sure what happened," said the world number two.
"I was just missing it. It was really unusual or weird. I was still waiting for some chance, and it didn't come unfortunately."
Kvitova has defeated Kiki Bertens and Kurumi Nara in imperious style in the first two rounds, and appeared set for another straight-sets win as she comfortably won  the first set in 29 minutes against the Serbian former world number one.

But, after taking an early break in the second set, Kvitova's serve faltered to allow her opponent back into the match and she found herself unable to contain the resurgent Jankovic in the decider.
"I felt like she was coming back, playing a little bit aggressive," Kvitova added.
"Suddenly, from my side, I didn't have an answer for it. My serve didn't help me at all this time.  I was really struggling with each shot which I played.
"It's tennis.  I'm still human.  I'm not a robot."
Kvitova has also made the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 2010 and the quarters in 2012 and 2013
