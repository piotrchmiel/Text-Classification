Douglas Carswell has refused to deny claims he has signed up to the Labour Party to vote for Jeremy Corbyn in the leadership election.
The Ukip MP told the Telegraph he thought it was "wonderful" that "comrade Corbyn" was doing so well, but said he would "neither confirm nor deny" whether or not he has voted for the hard-left candidate.

A Labour source said a researcher reported Mr Carswell to Labour's national executive over the weekend, after finding he had registered himself as an affiliated member of the party.
It comes as Labour undergo a process of vetting their electoral roll for Green and Tory activists, who have had signed up to vote for Mr Corbyn because they believe it would damage the party's chances of winning the next election.
Mr Carswell said: "I think it's wonderful that comrade Corbyn is doing as well as he seems to be doing. Onwards and upwards to the comrades."
The only Ukip MP said he believed very strongly in "our democracy" and in reforming the way that UK parties operate.
He added: "I neither confirm nor deny that I am supporting Jeremy Corbyn as an affiliated member of the Labour Party. If people want to have mischievous conversations, I'm going to add to the mischief."
Acting leader Harriet Harman has said the party have kicked out 3,000 infiltrators so far and has estimated the final size of the electorate could be around half a million.
