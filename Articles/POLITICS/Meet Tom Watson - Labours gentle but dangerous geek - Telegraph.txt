If you watched or heard the BBC’s coverage of police investigations into Ted Heath this week, you may have heard from a campaigner called Tom Watson talking about how he raised concerns about the former prime minister several years ago. A cuddly fellow with sad eyes, Mr Watson works tirelessly in public to expose sexual abuse by those in positions of power and authority.

Meanwhile, the rather smaller audience hungry for news about the race to become the Labour Party’s deputy leader learned that an MP called Tom Watson has been backed for that role by 174 constituency Labour parties, more than twice the number backing his nearest rival, and more even than are supporting the current people’s darling, Jeremy Corbyn, for the top job. A lethally efficient political operator, Mr Watson works tirelessly behind the scenes to bring the Labour movement under his control.
Together, these two Tom Watsons make up one of the most interesting and important figures in British politics today, as well as one of the least-acknowledged. While Corbynmania grips social media, people who do Labour politics in the real world know that Mr Watson’s seemingly inevitable advance to the deputy leadership may well prove more significant.

Personally, Mr Watson is gentle and even sensitive. He wears his big heart on his sleeve. His interests – computer games, obscure indy rock – are unashamedly geeky. Other weepy nerds might get bullied in the playground of life, but no one pushes Mr Watson around. Some of his Labour colleagues are frightened of him – literally frightened.

Writing for the New Statesman this week, my former colleague Stephen Bush quoted a Labour insider talking about Mr Corbyn and Mr Watson as Trotsky and Stalin. It’s an apt metaphor. Mr Corbyn is an ideologue and a thinker, while Mr Watson is doer, an organiser who understands supremely well how to marshal and employ political power, sometimes to destructive effect. A mere junior minister in Tony Blair’s government, in 2006 he assembled and deployed the forces that drove Labour’s most electorally successful leader from office the following year. From the opposition benches after 2010, he organised the campaign that closed the News of the World.
His commanding lead in the deputy leadership race owes much to organisation; some colleagues whisper that he started his campaign for the job two years ago, around the time he quit Ed Miliband’s shadow cabinet. Whoever ends up leading Labour would find Deputy Watson a major check on their authority, a force to be bargained with. If that leader is indeed Mr Corbyn, some despairing Labour MPs predict his demise well before the general election, with Mr Watson’s fingerprints carefully wiped off the ice pick.
What Mr Watson actually wants to do with the power he accumulates is rarely discussed. Some Tories who regard him as a simple trade union bovver boy (he shared a flat with Len McCluskey of Unite, and runs his deputy leadership campaign from a Unite office) lazily assume he’s an unreconstructed lefty.
In fact, he comes from the AEEU, the engineering union that was a cornerstone of the old Labour right wing and in the 1970s and 80s tried to hold the line against the militants and the acolytes of Tony Benn, the faction whose contemporary champion is, of course, Mr Corbyn. During his deputy leadership campaign, Mr Watson has talked about the need for Labour to win back working-class voters by hardening its position on immigration. He wants bigger Armed Forces and a tougher approach to Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

Such realism has been notably lacking from the Corbyn-dominated leadership contest, increasingly an auction of Left-wing fantasies. Mr Watson has no time for the purity of opposition. He knows politics is about power, that power comes from being in government, that getting back into government means defeating Labour’s opponents, that Labour’s biggest opponent is and always will be the Conservative Party.
And that brings us back to Mr Heath, one of several senior Conservatives whose conduct Mr Watson has questioned as part of his campaign over child abuse.
Mr Watson rejects utterly any suggestion that this campaign has any partisan dimension. He says he has “shared intelligence with the police regarding politicians from at least three political parties including my own”. And to be clear, I’m not questioning his motives here. I’m saying nothing at all about his motives. But it is a fact that Mr Watson is a Labour politician whose actions have contributed to public suspicions (thus far unproven) that senior Conservatives committed or condoned child abuse. Whatever his motives, one consequence of his actions is political benefit to the Labour Party.
A similar point can be made about Mr Watson’s campaign against Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers over phone hacking and other wrongdoing, a campaign that did significant financial and reputational harm to an organisation that had been politically critical of Labour. Media analysts like Roy Greenslade of The Guardian suggest Mr Watson has taken less interest in allegations of hacking at the Labour-supporting Mirror newspapers.
Personally, Mr Watson is gentle and even sensitive. He wears his big heart on his sleeve. His interests – computer games, obscure indy rock – are unashamedly geeky. Other weepy nerds might get bullied in the playground of life, but no one pushes Mr Watson around. Some of his Labour colleagues are frightened of him – literally frightened.
Whenever interviewers put his fearsome reputation to him, he says he’s baffled and even hurt by it. If he reads it, he’ll probably say he’s unhappy about this piece too. In another politician, that reaction would be disingenuous or even deceitful, but I suspect Mr Watson is genuine here, that he really doesn’t think he’s a bully or a fixer or any of the other unpleasant things he’s been called and will be called again. I suspect he truly believes he’s a good person trying to do the right thing, doing what must be done to make the world a better place. And that’s what makes him so interesting, so formidable, and so dangerous.
