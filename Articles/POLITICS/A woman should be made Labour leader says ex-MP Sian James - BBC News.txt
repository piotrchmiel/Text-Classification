A woman should be made leader of the Labour Party, according to a former Welsh MP.
Sian James, who quit as Labour MP for Swansea East in April, said the party should move on from the "men in suits".
Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper, Jeremy Corbyn and Liz Kendall are battling it out in the Labour leadership contest.
Ms James said: "It's time we give women a go, we've had the men in suits. We've had the men saying 'this is the way to do it, ladies'."
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement, she added: "The leadership contest is capturing the public's imagination.
"We are pretty robust in the Labour Party. We've got to pick ourselves up after the general election and get ready for the assembly elections.
"It's really exciting times. It's important we go into that assembly election and the next general election strong and united behind a leader.
"And do you know what, it's time we gave a woman a go.
"I'm really excited about the opportunity to discuss it and move forward."
Ballot papers will be sent out to Labour Party members on 14 August and voting will take place by post and online.
All votes must be returned by 10 September and the result will be announced two days later.
