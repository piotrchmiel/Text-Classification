Labour leadership contender Jeremy Corbyn has suggested Tony Blair could be made to stand trial for war crimes over the invasion of Iraq.
"Is he going to be tried for it? I don't know," he told Newsnight's Emily Maitlis. "Could he be tried for it? Possibly."
"It was an illegal war... and he [Tony Blair] has to explain to that."
