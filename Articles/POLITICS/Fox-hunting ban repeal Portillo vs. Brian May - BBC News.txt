Musician Brian May spoke out against government plans to repeal the ban on fox-hunting passed by the last Labour government.
He told Andrew Neil on This Week fox-hunting was cruel, and that the classification of foxes as "vermin" was simply used to justify killing them.
But he was challenged by former Conservative minister Michael Portillo, who said he was wary of attempts to "extinguish a nation's culture", and added that if he were in Parliament currently he would vote to repeal the ban.
