After 16 years in the host's chair Jon Stewart said goodbye to The Daily Show
The comedian's final appearance featured tongue-in-cheek tributes from politicians including Hillary Clinton and John McCain, and music from Bruce Springsteen.

Stewart, 52, opened the show at his desk by saying: "Welcome to The Daily Show, my name is Jon Stewart. I've got big news. This is it, this is the final episode."

When Stewart started at the The Daily Show in 1999 it was a "fake news" programme, but five years later a Time magazine poll named him the most trusted source of news on American television.

In the finale Hillary Clinton bemoaned in a taped message that Stewart was leaving "just when I'm running for president. What a bummer".

Stewart said: "Rather than saying 'goodbye' or 'good night' I'm just going to say 'I'm going to get a drink'.
Audience member Randy Gunnell, 29 said: "From start to finish, it was fantastic. It was emotional, people crying all over the place."
Roger Ailes, chairman of Fox News Channel which Stewart took many swipes at, told the Hollywood Reporter: "He's been after us for years. Occasionally we pay attention. We think he's funny. We never took it seriously and he never made a dent in us."
The final show coincided with the first Republican debate - and drew favourable comparisons against the Donald Trump circus:
