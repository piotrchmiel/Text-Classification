Clinton warns GOP will repeal Obamacare

HANOVER, N.H. (AP) â€” Hillary Rodham Clinton is warning New Hampshire voters that if the country elects a Republican president, the next administration will repeal President Barack Obama's health care overhaul.
The Democratic presidential front-runner says she will offer continuity on the policies under Obama that have worked for the vast majority of Americans. And she says the federal budget was in order under her husband's administration until it was "rudely interrupted" by Republicans.
Clinton tells 850 people at a park at Dartmouth College she hopes the U.S. will get a deal "that puts a lid" on Iran's nuclear program. But she says Iran will still cause major problems as a sponsor of terrorism.
The event was moved outdoors and comes as rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has drawn big crowds around the country.
