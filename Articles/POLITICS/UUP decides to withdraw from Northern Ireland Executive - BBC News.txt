The Ulster Unionist Party's ruling body has voted unanimously in favour of withdrawing from government.
It follows a proposal made by the UUP's leader Mike Nesbitt to the party's executive.
He had made the recommendation after police in Northern Ireland said members of the Provisional IRA were involved in murdering ex-IRA man Kevin McGuigan Sr.
Mr Nesbitt said Danny Kennedy, the UUP's only executive minister, would tender his resignation on Tuesday.
