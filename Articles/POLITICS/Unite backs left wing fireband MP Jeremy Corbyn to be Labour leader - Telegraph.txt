Unite, Britain’s biggest unions which donates millions of pounds to Labour every year, has told its members to back left wing MP Jeremy Corbyn to be Labour leader.
The decision, which was predicted by The Telegraph on Saturday, was taken by the party’s 63-strong ruling executive at a meeting today.
Unite is a major Labour supporters. In the first three months of this year alone, the union donated £3.5million to the party.
The executive decided that members should support Mr Corbyn, followed by Andy Burnham in the alternative vote system.

The decision is a big boost for Mr Corbyn, who has been well received at hustings involving trade unions in recent weeks.
Mr Corbyn, who only made it onto the ballot with minutes to spare after MPs lent him their votes to broaden the debate, has called for the party to reject austerity.
Union sources have told The Telegraph that Unite wanted to back the leftwinger as there was “a feeling we need to nail our colours to the mast”.
Alistair Darling, the former Labour chancellor, urged people not to back Mr Corbyn on Sunday.
He told Sky News’ Murnaghan that he was “not sure" electing Mr Corbyn as Labour leader “will get us back into Government”.

Another union – the GMB – is also thought to be ready to declare its backing for Mr Corbyn.
The candidates are being elected on the One Member One Vote system which means candidates will be elected by members and registered and affiliated supporters – each has a maximum of one vote.
Unite is Britain and Ireland’s largest trade union with over 1.4 million members working across all sectors of the economy. The general secretary is Len McCluskey.
