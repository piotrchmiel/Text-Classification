The Secret Service arrested a Wisconsin man Thursday after he allegedly told a security guard he planned to kill President Obama, a federal official confirmed to Fox News.
55-year-old Brian Dutcher of Tomah allegedly made the threat the same day Obama was in La Crosse touting a proposal to make more workers eligible for overtime pay.
Dutcher allegedly told a security guard at a La Crosse library, “the usurper is here and if I get a chance I’ll take him out and I’ll take the shot,” referring to Obama, MyFox8.com reported. According to the affidavit, Dutcher told a La Crosse police detective his threat was serious.
U.S. Attorney John Vaudreuil told the Wisconsin State Journal Dutcher was being held in the mental health facility.
