Krauthammer: Police is "defenseless"
Charles Krauthammer told viewers Wednesday on “Special Report with Bret Baier” that police in the United States are “essentially left unprotected.”
“There is a reason that these murder rates are going up,” said Krauthammer, a syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor. “That is because we’re having a slow motion police strike where police are either not going into the neighborhoods or pulling away in a dangerous incident over confrontation.”
Krauthammer added that police now worry about how they will look on video instead of protecting people, “once you have to add that factor, the policeman is defenseless.”
