An Iranian-born British woman who was educated at one of the top private girls' schools in the UK, Camila Batmanghelidjh founded stricken charity Kids Company in 1996.
She was born in Iran but was educated in the UK, first at Sherborne Girls in Dorset, then at Warwick University, where she acheived a First in theatre and dramatic arts.

She founded her charity Kids Company in 1996 in south London, and it grew to have centres in London, Bristol and Liverpool.
The charity was forced to close earlier this month after allegations surfaced about financial mismanagement and the Metropolitan Police announced that their sexual exploitation unit was investigating criminal offences alleged to have taken place at the charity's centres.

Former workers have spoken out about a culture of waste and extravagance, including bizarre practices such as workers being hired off the street.
Ms Batmanghelidjh has denied all allegations of financial wrongdoing.
