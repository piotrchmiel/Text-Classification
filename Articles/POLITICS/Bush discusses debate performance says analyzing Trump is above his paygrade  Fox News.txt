Jeb Bush rates his debate performance: I thought I did great
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Friday shrugged off criticism that he came off as tepid, uneven and cautious during the first primetime 2016 Republican debate held Thursday night.
“I thought I did great,” Bush told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, adding he was “confident” he would be the next GOP nominee for the White House.
Bush said he thought he did well Thursday and was able to “talk about the things that were important” to him including education.
“I want to win, I want to win the presidency,” he said.
When asked about businessman Donald Trump’s performance, Bush said “trying to analyze Trump is way above my pay grade.”
Bush also dismissed concerns he was running in a political race against candidates who were outwardly more aggressive.
“If I get attacked, don’t worry,” Bush said. “I’ll fight back.”
