Krauthammer on Trump reaction to debate
Syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer said Friday on “Special Report with Bret Baier” that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s comments indicating he was treated unfairly during a primetime Fox News debate create “a bit of a paradox.”
“This is a guy who’s running as the tough guy,” Krauthammer said. “The foundation of his campaign is our negotiators, our president, our administrations are stupid. They’re weak, they get kicked over in negotiations.”
In contrast to the Obama administration,  Krauthammer said Trump has promised to “kill China in negotiations,” “build a wall and… make Mexico pay for it,” and “stare down Putin.”
In the face of Trump's bold promises, Krauthammer concluded Trump’s reaction to difficult questions during the debate just didn’t add up.
“He says he was treated not nicely by three Fox News anchors. It doesn’t quite fit,” Krauthammer said.
