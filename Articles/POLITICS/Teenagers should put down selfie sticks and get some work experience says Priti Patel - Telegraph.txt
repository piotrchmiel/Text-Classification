Teenagers should "step away from the selfie stick and put down snapchat" and do some work experience this Summer if they want to get on in life, a minister has said.
Priti Patel, the employment minister, said young people should use their holidays to "broaden their horizons" and make the first steps into the World of work.
She said that when she was young she helped her father, a shopkeeper, as he got up every day at 4am to deliver newspapers.

She said: "My father set up his first business in the 1970s so that he could support his family. He got up at 4am every day, delivering the morning newspapers while I helped by stuffing the Sunday papers with supplements. Seeing his drive and determination to make his business a success taught me about hard graft and the values of work."
In an article for The Sun, she said: "I'd encourage all young people to get involved and use their summer holidays to broaden their horizons and help set up the rest of their life.
"This is the perfect opportunity to step away from the selfie sticks and put down Snapchat and do some work experience. It will boost chances of getting a foot on the career ladder, an apprenticeship or even a job."
She said that employers also have a duty to offer young people work experience to help find "the business leaders of tomorrow".
She said: "The onus, however, is not just on young people. Employers have a huge role to play in helping the young people of today be the business leaders of tomorrow.
"By offering work experience in their organisation they can help train their future workforce and give young people the skills that will carry them through their life and career.
This should be at the heart of every business."
