During this year’s general election, a casual observer might easily have gained the impression from the Labour Party’s near-hysterical campaigning that countless millions of British workers were painfully trapped on zero‑hours contracts, a form of employment little better than modern slavery. And despite winning that election, the Conservatives have been keen to steal some of Labour’s clothes, adopting policies such as a “living wage” and tough rhetoric on employers who do not pay it.
In this context, official statistics on zero-hours contracts are instructive. Some 744,000 people are employed on contracts that do not guarantee a minimum number of hours. That is 2.4 per cent of workers. A fifth of them are students. While 41 per cent of zero-hours workers want more work than they get, the majority are content with their hours. And only 12 per cent of zero-hours workers want another job. To say the least, these figures are hard to reconcile with the Labour propaganda.
Britain’s labour market, flexible and free, is one of the country’s great strengths. Where other European countries saw unemployment soar during the recent economic crisis and still suffer from a dire lack of jobs, Britain was able to maintain record levels of employment. Often, that was because flexible terms of employment allowed employers to reduce wages and hours instead of staff numbers. That was painful for many workers, but less painful than being sacked: a job with reduced pay or hours is preferable to no job at all. Zero-hours contracts are a small but important part of that flexible market. Workers clearly recognise and value that flexibility. Politicians, of all parties, should do so too.
