Britain should not take “more and more refugees”, David Cameron has said in his clearest indication that he will not bow to pressure from Germany to accept thousands of migrants entering Europe.
The Prime Minister rejected calls from European leaders for Britain to take “its fair share” of migrants.
Hundreds of thousands of migrants are flooding into Europe from Syria and Africa, leaving a number of countries struggling to cope.
German chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU alliance on Tuesday said that Britain's failure to accept more refugees could hurt Mr Cameron's plans to renegotiate the country's relationship with the European Union.
And Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham, two of the candidates to become Labour leader, have both called on the Government to take around 10,000 refugees.

During a visit in Northamptonshire, Mr Cameron said: "We have taken a number of genuine asylum seekers from Syrian refugee camps and we keep that under review, but we think the most important thing is to try to bring peace and stability to that part of the world.
"I don't think there is an answer that can be achieved simply by taking more and more refugees."
Mr Cameron said Britain was focusing on stabilising and improving the countries where migrants and refugees come from and highlighted action the Government is taking to improve security at the French port of Calais.
He said: "We are taking action right across the board, helping countries from which these people are coming, stabilising them and trying to make sure there are worthwhile jobs and stronger economies there.
"We are obviously taking action at Calais and the Channel, there's more that we need to do and we are working together with our European partners as well. These are big challenges but we will meet them.
