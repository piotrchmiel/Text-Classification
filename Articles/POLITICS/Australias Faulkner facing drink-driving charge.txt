Australia's Faulkner facing drink-driving charge

London (AFP) - Australia all-rounder James Faulkner accepted Friday he had made an "error of judgement" after being charged with drink-driving by Greater Manchester Police while playing for English county side Lancashire.
The 25-year-old has been released on bail and now faces a court hearing in Manchester on July 21.
Cricket Australia, who have charged the World Cup winner under its own code of conduct, "returned a blood alcohol reading of approximately twice the UK's legal limit".
The first disciplinary action Faulkner has faced is to be dropped from Friday's Twenty20 Roses clash against Yorkshire.
"I can't excuse my actions and understand that I have let people down," Faulkner said in a Cricket Australia statement. "My decision to drive was an error in judgement.
"I apologise unreservedly and accept any penalty handed to me by Cricket Australia and the relevant authorities."
CA performance director Pat Howard said: "It is clear that he made a very poor decision to get behind the wheel of a car after drinking and that decision had potential to cause serious harm to him and others.
"It is also clear that he is very disappointed and embarrassed by his actions given his position as a role-model to young people.
"This is a very real wake-up call for James and all other Australian cricketers around the importance of responsible decision making.
"I have expressed my extreme disappointment and have informed him of the consequences under English Law and Cricket Australiaâ€™s own regulations."
