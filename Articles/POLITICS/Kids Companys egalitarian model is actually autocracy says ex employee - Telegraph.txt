Kids Company has died as it lived, in full Technicolor and high volume Dolby surround sound.
Trying to sift claim from counter-claim, principle from practice, rumour from fact and celebrity endorsement from academic research in the aftermath of the charity’s collapse is a challenge.
There are those, including its founder Camila Batmanghelidjh, who see in its downfall a smear campaign or a government plot, and others who see an egregious case of – at the very least – financial mismanagement.
I hope we all see the children who feel abandoned by a service – whatever its merits or demerits – that they counted on.
I came to Kids Company initially as a volunteer in 2008. I had a naïve belief that I might ‘give back’ in some way for the privilege of my own background and education; that I might make a move from academia into something more satisfying.
That I was able to do that puts me in Batmanghelidjh’s debt.

I am certainly one of those whose lives have been changed by contact with Kids Company, though not perhaps, in ways that its leader would have envisaged.
• Alan Yentob: I was right to act on BBC coverage of Kids Company
It was a charity that had an idiosyncratic approach to supporting disadvantaged young people: its varied services ranged from intensive therapeutic support to hot meals, home decorating and hair cuts.
Kids Company’s Urban Academy, a post-16 educational centre in southeast London was a colourful place, its walls covered with murals. It was noisy: the canteen at lunchtime was a tumult of voices and languages.
It was pungent: the smell of cooking; the toilets; the whiff of marijuana from the street.

It was also tense: especially on a Friday when the weekly distribution of allowances took place and young people came by for their cash and travel cards.
Kids Company was an ‘‘improvisational’’ organisation. I was not the only member of staff with no formal background in social care or youth work who was swiftly given responsibilities for offering young people practical and emotional support.
I did my best. I had good intentions. I hope I did no harm. But I cannot be sure that I did any good.
I left Kids Company after 18 months, despite a promotion to a role as ‘head of education policy’ because of that uncertainty. I wanted a more systematic structure.
I wanted to know that funding raised for a project would be spent on that project, that reporting – particularly of the number of service users – would reflect the reality of delivery, that educational provision would meet the right standards, that outcomes would be measurable.

This double-edged approach to challenging criticism: suppression and dismissal, was effective for a long time.

Above all I wanted some sense of the benefit that I was bringing, or indeed, failing to bring. I wanted to know if the model was any good.
Those questions stayed with me. They influenced the direction of my career, my interest in evaluation and the measurement of social impact - and my continued critical engagement with the charity’s published figures.
But Kids Company was ideologically vociferous, both in the beliefs propounded so vigorously internally and externally - and in the silencing of critique.
In July of last year I was commissioned to write a piece about the charity, looking at its published record on evaluation and the central role played by Batmanghelidjh in its activities. I submitted my article, which, though certainly critical, was also intended to be constructive, and Kids Company was approached for comment.
At that point, after a phone call from the charity, the article was pulled. At the same time, the journalist Miles Goslett was experiencing similar difficulties in publishing an article about the misgivings of a donor. When his piece was eventually accepted by The Spectator, he generously linked through to my article which I published as a blog.
This made neither of us popular with Kids Company. Camila Batmanghelidjh is not a woman who admits to her faults or who willingly concedes control.
This trait explains much about Kids Company’s collapse, and the way she has come out fighting despite its closure.
In an unpublished evaluation of the first Kids Company centre undertaken for the National Children’s Bureau in 2001 she explained the management structure of the charity: “…you know, somebody might say, well, it’s not a democratic structure. There isn’t senior management […] And the reason is that I can’t guarantee that [Kids Company’s staff] won’t get into really childish modes and abuse those systems. I prefer to keep it so that it’s quite egalitarian but at the end of the day one person has the final say.”
'That picture of Batmanghelidjh surrounded by Gwyneth Paltrow, Stella McCartney and Claudia Schiffer - doesn’t it sum up all that is facile and pathetic about society?'
That “quite egalitarian” is telling. What is described is an autocracy.
Batmanghelidjh saw herself policing the “childish modes” of her staff who could not be trusted in a democratic system. In that world, the voices of staff and young people had little force; she would always be the arbiter who had “the final say”.
The same 2001 report revealed that many staff were concerned about Batmanghelidjh’s favouritism of certain young people, exercised by giving them money and goods.
This too was dismissed by her: “there is also a difficulty, according to the Director [Batmanghelidjh] which arises from members of staff […] who have had similar lives to the young people at the project, and so feel envious of the help certain young people receive”.
That is a powerfully dismissive response to staff concern about an unequal distribution of scarce resources amongst vulnerable children. Criticism is emotional and motivated by envy, rather than rational and motivated by principle.
In that kind of system, any critical analysis is negated as a matter of course. The language used by Batmanghelidjh about her critics this last week reflects this worldview: former children’s minister Tim Loughton is “disingenuous”, the BBC is “irresponsible”, Miles Goslett’s “psychological abilities need a little bit more development”.
Criticising Kids Company demonstrates a mental or emotional problem possessed by the critic. It is never reasonable.
This double-edged approach to challenging criticism: suppression and dismissal, was effective for a long time. Its effectiveness may have been a contributing factor in the charity’s end. Questionable practices had remained unchallenged for so long at Kids Company that there was no solid ground on which to stand when external gazes were no longer so kindly.
We don’t yet know the findings of the police investigation into unreported crime and sexual abuse at the charity; evidence of the effectiveness of interventions remains patchy and – still – largely unpublished; that there was mismanagement of the charity’s finances seems clear but is still being denied by both Batmanghelidjh and Alan Yentob, the Kids Company Chair of Trustees; the dust will take some time to settle.
What lessons can we learn in the immediate aftermath? I think we can say with certainty that all charities require scrutiny, that indeed they should welcome it as a necessary corollary to the increasing role that the third sector is playing in public service provision. We can also say that the numbers matter. Data is important, figures of attendance and reach are important, and we can and should test the public claims made by charities.
This needn’t mean a new regulator, or even a strengthened Charity Commission.
We could, for instance, borrow Charity Navigator from the United States. This is an online resource that rates charities based on their financial health, their accountability and transparency and, soon, their reporting of results. Under each one of these headings they would have issued a health warning about Kids Company.
That warning, made publicly, backed by data and sound method and influencing donations, might have helped to bring about the necessary change at the charity before it was too late.
