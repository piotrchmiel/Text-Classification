Charities and local authorities have met to draw up emergency plans to provide support for children following the sudden closure of the charity Kids Company on Wednesday amid claims of financial mismanagement.
Its founder, Camila Batmanghelidjh, denies these and says the charity is the victim of a malicious campaign to discredit it.
The BBC has heard allegations that a number of incidents at the charity were not properly handled.
The Metropolitan Police last week announced they were investigating a number of allegations involving the charity.
