Senator Baldwin announces support for Iran nuclear deal

WASHINGTON Senator Tammy Baldwin said on Friday she would support the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration because it will "best serve America's national security interests."
Baldwin's emailed statement came a day after another Democratic senator, Chuck Schumer of New York, said he opposed the deal.
