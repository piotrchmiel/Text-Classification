Hardly a day goes past without a story in the media about charitie. Once, these would have been good news tales of dedicated philanthropists giving up their time and effort to help others less fortunate. This country has a long and proud record of charitable activity. But something has gone badly wrong with the sector.
Yesterday, we learnt how Angelina Jolie, the Hollywood actress, had resigned from a mine-clearance charity made famous by Diana, Princess of Wales, in a dispute over trustees paying themselves. Then, the RSPCA was accused of snooping on the wills of donors to see how much more they could extract.

There is nothing wrong with charities being ambitious about their fundraising; after all, it’s what pays for their work. But like every other business, they must first comply with the law – and the data-protection rules are some of the toughest in the land. Furthermore, in the pursuit of cash, some of our leading charities seem to have forgotten the importance of respecting their supporters.
All of these matters – including the dramatic collapse of Kids Company last month – suggest a failure of the old model of charities run by trustees. Some of our leading good causes, including the NSPCC, British Red Cross and Oxfam are being threatened with criminal sanctions in response to their fundraising tactics. The likes of Dame Hilary Blume of the Charities Advisory Trust are castigating charity workers, saying, “We want people who have a higher ethical standard.”

There are 1,939 children's charities in England and Wales; 581 trying to cure cancer; 354 for birds

Far from being the cure for society’s ills, the charity sector is being seen as the poison in the system. How has it come to this and what can we do to fix it? UK charities are big business. They have a combined annual turnover of £65 billion, more employees and non-executives than the NHS, and are supported by more than 3.7 million volunteers. But scratch the surface and it’s a bloated mass of duplication and waste.
More than 180,000 charities are registered with the Charity Commission. Just 2,100 account for a staggering 70 per cent of the sector’s income, while only 35p from every £1 raised is shared between the 133,000 smallest charities (80 per cent of the total), who each donate less than £10,000 annually to their good causes.
Duplication is endemic. In his book The Great Charity Scandal, David Craig identified 1,939 active children’s charities in England and Wales; 581 charities trying to cure cancer; 354 for birds; 255 for animals, 81 for people with alcohol problems and 69 fighting leukaemia. They are all competing for the same finite pool of money.

Too often there’s an over-reliance on inexperienced volunteers and part-timers to fulfil the key roles of finance and trusteeship. The sector is crying out for rationalisation through merger. It’s been talked about for years; but the holier-than-thou approach many charities take to their cause, combined with their ad hoc back offices, means that there’s little motivation to develop in this way. Some thought the impact of the financial crash would kick-start conglomeration because money dried up and costs rose. Yet the number of charities continues to grow, outstripping revenue growth.
This is going to get worse without the systemic change that only government can bring about. We need a Big Bang in the sector, with potential and existing charities required to justify why they are not joining others sharing the same purpose. This should be overseen by a charity equivalent of Ofsted to help them improve performance, prevent abuse and give confidence to funders and other stakeholders. And society needs to grow up about the commercialism of the sector: people need to understand that professionalism and investment are essential if charities are to meet the growing need for their services.
None the less, it is far too easy to become a charity and retain the benefits of charitable status. In its latest annual report, the Charity Commission found that only 27 per cent of accounts in the 2012 sample fully met the legal requirement for reporting “public benefit”.

Yet with its annual budget halved to £20 million, the commission’s activities are severely limited: last year it made just 137 compliance and inspection visits. Its effectiveness has been brought into sharp relief by the demise of Kids Company. With a cash-strapped state withdrawing from many areas of post-war social provision, the Third Sector is needed more than ever. And yet, at this crucial time, charities are between a rock and a hard place, on the one hand expected to be run for nothing by saintly volunteers and on the other criticised for not being hard-nosed enough.
They are the foundation of the Big Society that David Cameron may not talk about much any more yet is playing an increasingly important role in modern Britain.
If Mr Cameron wants to turn his passion for social reform into a reality and maintain some of our most valued services then he needs to take a bold and long overdue step towards radical reform of the charity sector.
