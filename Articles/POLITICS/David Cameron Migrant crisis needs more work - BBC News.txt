Prime Minister David Cameron has admitted that ''more work'' needs to be done to tackle the migrant crisis in Calais.
Speaking after chairing a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee, Mr Cameron said the situation was "not acceptable".
And he promised to take action, both in France and the UK.
"We are keen to work hand in glove with them to reduce pressure on that side of the border,'' he said.
