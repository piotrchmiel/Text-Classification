Britain's defense minister says lawmakers should consider expanding Royal Air Force airstrikes against the Islamic State from Iraq into Syria.
Defense Secretary Michael Fallon told the House of Commons on Thursday that there was a case for taking action in Syria, but the government would "not bring a motion to this House on which there is not some consensus."
Fallon said "any action we take must not provide any succor to Assad or Assad's regime." But he added that it was clear that IS activity "in Iraq and elsewhere - and probably in Libya - are being directed from northern Syria."

But lawmaker Crispin Blunt, chairman of parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, said British strikes in Syria would make "no practical difference" to the US-led military campaign and would lead Britain into a legal gray area.
Vernon Coaker, defense spokesman for the opposition Labour Party, said Labour would consider backing Syria action, but it "must command the support of other nations in the region, including Iraq and the coalition already taking action in Syria."

In September, MPs voted to attack militants in Iraq, but not Syria.
No vote on the issue is scheduled, and Cameron's office said more deliberation was needed before a decision could be made.
