Larry the Number 10 cat could be out of a job in David Cameron’s next reshuffle.
Downing Street’s “chief mouser” – who is rumoured to prefer sleeping to hunting – has been shown up by George Osborne and his colleague Matthew Hancock, the Cabinet Office Minister.

During top-level talks ahead of this week’s Budget, a mouse ran across the sofa in the Chancellor’s office, sending one official screaming from the room.
Undeterred, Mr Osborne and Mr Hancock leapt from their seats and chased the rogue rodent until eventually they had it cornered.
