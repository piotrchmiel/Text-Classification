The Ted Heath I knew was awkward, yes, but these allegations are baseless - Telegraph

In the corridors of Westminster in the late 1980s and early 1990s, rumours sometimes swirled: the names of various senior politicians were whispered in connection with alleged sexual abuse of children. But however much they were discussed privately, such whispers were not made public. Not, that is, until much later. And in all my time there, working as private secretary to Sir Edward Heath, I never once heard his name mentioned in this context. Nor did it ever occur to me to doubt him. Today, 10, years after his death, it still doesn’t.
There were, back then, persistent rumours he was gay. But that, as we have surely learnt by now, is very, very different from being a paedophile. I saw no evidence he was gay, and it would hardly matter now in any case, since the vast majority of voters quite rightly don’t give a damn about politicians’ sexual orientation.
Sir Edward did once tell me that on two occasions he had “come close” to getting engaged to different women, both a long time ago, and one certainly before he was in public life. My sense then, as now, was that marriage was so low down on his radar that he would only have considered it if he felt it would help his career. If I had to pick a bracket to put him in, I would say he was asexual. Politics, music and sailing were his true passions.
It was, I suppose, an unusual way to live one’s life, but now, posthumously and to the horror of his friends, it seems to have become enough to destroy his reputation forever. Seven police forces are investigating separate allegations that he abused youngsters and the Independent Police Complaints Commission is carrying out its own inquiry.
One of the forces involved is on Jersey. The “evidence” against Sir Edward appears to rest on the assumption that, because he would sometimes take his yacht, Morning Cloud, in its various incarnations, over to the Channel Islands, he must have been doing so because he was a paedophile wanting to prey on children on the island. It would be laughable if it weren’t so serious: by this logic, every holidaymaker who goes there is laying themselves open to accusation.

Morning Cloud was an ocean-going yacht. It required a crew of eight to 10 people to sail it. By the time I was working for Sir Edward (1988-1992), he no longer sailed, but part of my job was to arrange reunions of former crew members. They were a tight-knit group from a wide variety of backgrounds, with a close camaraderie and used to living at close quarters on board. Had Sir Edward jumped ship once in Jersey for a couple of hours to get up to no good, they would have noticed his absence. The whole idea is inconceivable.
The same is true of some of the other allegations aired this week, which cover the period after 1965 when he became Leader of the Opposition. From that moment on, every minute of every day would have been recorded and accounted for in his diary. He would have had a government driver and, from 1970 when he was elected as Prime Minister, would also have had Special Branch officers with him at all times, right up to his death in 2005.
That is what makes Sir Edward different from those other “names” who have been revealed of late as paedophiles. None of them lived under such constant supervision and scrutiny as he did. They had opportunities to slip away, off the radar. Sir Edward did not.
In my time with him – which began in 1986 when I was a politics undergraduate at Leeds University and landed an internship in his private office for nine months, and ended in 1992 – I got to know many of my predecessors as his private secretary.
All had followed the same routine as me. Everything he did was planned and known. His life was run like a military campaign. Even if he was meeting close friends – and this, I’m afraid, shows a not nice side of politics and of his steely determination – there would be an agenda beforehand and a follow-up discussion afterwards. A simple dinner in a restaurant with friends would always have a purpose. And, of course, there would be a police officer nearby as it took place.
One of the allegations made against Sir Edward dates back to 1961, before he had really made his mark on the political scene and was therefore not under such close scrutiny. In that sense, I would concede offending behaviour was technically possible, but it rests on the assumption that Sir Edward was somehow capable of leading a double life, being one thing to those around him, and another when out of our sight.
'What makes Sir Edward different from those other 'names' who have been revealed of late as paedophiles is none of them lived under such constant supervision and scrutiny as he did
That just wasn’t the man I knew and admired. One of the reasons he failed to connect with voters as Prime Minister was that he would not listen to the image consultants who wanted him to pretend to be something he wasn’t in order to woo the public. It was once suggested he should attend a football match, for instance, to show how he understood “ordinary” people. He couldn’t do it. He was what he was and, to a certain extent, revelled in being awkward and unpopular.
That’s not to say there weren’t times when he could be very good company. I remember once, at his invitation, taking a group of fellow students on my MBA course down to his house in Salisbury for lunch. He was on such fine form it continued afterwards in a local pub, where he had them in hysterics.
But it is his awkwardness for which he will be remembered, and which somehow now is also giving credence to these baseless allegations against him. The upside of this trait was that, if he believed on reflection that a particular course of action was correct, he would go ahead regardless of how it might affect his personal ratings. Today’s politicians might take note.
The downside was that his awkwardness could make everyone around him feel awkward too, so much so that they weren’t willing to tell him when he was getting things wrong. Yet despite all that, he was a man of achievement. He was the prime minister who took Britain into the European Union. Some may debate the wisdom of that, but it is now part of our history.
These new allegations mean his long record of public service will be forever overshadowed by the suggestion that he might have been a paedophile. When the various police investigations finally conclude in years to come, as I believe they will, that there is not a shred of real evidence against him, there will still be those who continue to believe there is “no smoke without fire”; that there has been a high-level conspiracy to cover up his misdeeds.
'They seem to regard the public and enduring humiliation of Sir Edward a price worth paying for establishing whether there are genuine grounds for suspicion against him'
What has happened to the principle of innocent until proven guilty? Contrast the sight of a Wiltshire police officer standing outside Sir Edward’s former home in Salisbury this week, inviting further allegations of sexual abuse against an ex-prime minister, and the anonymity granted to the “former senior officer” in the same police force whose recollections of a cover-up are what seems to have prompted this open season on Sir Edward.
Like many of his friends with whom I have spoken this week, I have found the behaviour of the Wiltshire force shocking - especially in the light of South Yorkshire Police’s inept and much criticised televised raid last year on the Berkshire home of Cliff Richard following an allegation against him. Have the police learnt nothing from their own mistakes?
I appreciate, to an extent, the Catch 22 situation in which they find themselves. They have to be seen to be taking any allegation seriously, rather than, as has sadly too often been the case in the past, sweeping it under the carpet. But they seem to regard the public and enduring humiliation of Sir Edward a price worth paying for establishing whether there are genuine grounds for suspicion against him.
While there is no easy answer, the statement this week from the brothel madam, Myra Forde, denying any involvement with Sir Edward - and indeed any knowledge of allegations of misconduct against him - does place a big question mark against the Wiltshire police force’s approach. It has been said that Forde, who has been convicted of perverting the course of justice in the past, was the original source in the early 1990s for the suspicions about Sir Edward’s conduct.
The best you can say about the police’s current strategy is that it is risky. If more allegations arise, and if they can be substantiated, then officers will be judged on balance to have acted properly in the public interest. If not, then they have sullied the reputation of a private, difficult man who gave his whole life at the very highest level to public service. Only time will tell.
