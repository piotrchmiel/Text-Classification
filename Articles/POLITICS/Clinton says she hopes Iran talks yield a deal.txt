Clinton says she hopes Iran talks yield a deal

HANOVER, N.H. U.S. Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton said on Friday she hoped that 18 months of nuclear talks between Iran and major powers would yield a deal to curb Iran's nuclear program.
"I so hope that we are able to get a deal in the next week that puts a lid on Iran's nuclear weapons program," the former secretary of state told a rally on the Dartmouth College campus in Hanover, New Hampshire, adding that even if a deal is reached, there will be more work to be done.
Iran is in talks with the United States and five other powers - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - on an agreement to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions.
Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for November 2016, has generally not commented publicly on the Iran talks since launching her White House bid in April.
Commenting on the preliminary nuclear deal that was reached just before she announced her candidacy, Clinton said, "Getting the rest of the way to a final deal by June won't be easy, but it is absolutely crucial."
Since leaving the State Department in 2013, Clinton has been critical of some aspects of the Obama administration's foreign policy.
The former U.S. senator and first lady has a big lead in opinion polls over four Democratic challengers.
The winner of the Democratic nominating race will face the victor of the Republican contest, in which 14 candidates are competing.
