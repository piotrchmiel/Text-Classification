Brussels (AFP) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted Thursday the migrant crisis is a German problem, not a European one as he defended his government's handling of a wave of refugees.
"The problem is not a European problem, the problem is a German problem," Orban told a press conference in Brussels, adding that migrants were all flocking to Germany via his and other countries.
