Nicola Sturgeon has been setting out Holyrood's legislative programme for the coming year.
The first minister told MSPs she wanted to introduce a Scottish social security bill in the first year of the new parliament: "This bill will begin to put in place the essential delivery infrastructure for a new Scottish social security system.... This bill will make provision for the earliest possible abolition of the bedroom tax."
Education, health care and support for business were among the priorities in the last programme for government before the Scottish Parliament elections in May.
