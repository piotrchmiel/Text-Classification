George Osborne has said that the benefit cap will be cut to Â£23,000 in London but it will be "lower than that in the rest of the country".
Speaking to the Andrew Marr Show, the Chancellor said that it was "not fair" that people out of work could earn more than those in work.
He also told the BBC that those on high incomes in subsidised council housing would have to pay up to the market rent for their properties.
