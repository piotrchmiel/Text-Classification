AUSTIN, Texas –  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's office hired several people from his campaign and elsewhere before they submitted applications or the jobs were posted publicly, as required by state law.
The Austin American-Statesman reports (http://atxne.ws/1M1A8Kq ) that five people from Paxton's successful campaign last year were given administrative jobs in the attorney general's office. Five others came from former Gov. Rick Perry's office, and four more worked for U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz.
Only one of those jobs was advertised -- and records show Paxton's office had chosen someone for it the day before the posting went online.
The hires highlight ethics laws that are often ignored and have no enforcement mechanisms behind them.
A spokeswoman for Paxton says it is "common practice" for an elected official to appoint top deputies.
