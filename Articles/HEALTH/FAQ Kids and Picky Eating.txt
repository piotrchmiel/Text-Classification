FAQ: Kids and Picky Eating


Aug. 3, 2015 -- Children's picky eating, often dismissed by parents and doctors as just a phase, can sometimes signal more serious issues such as anxiety or depression.
"It's not necessarily something that goes away for all kids," says William Copeland, PhD, associate professor of psychiatry at Duke University School of Medicine. Copeland is part of a team at Duke that researched the problem. Their study found that 1 in 5 children might have a picky eating problem.
For some kids, it can be a red flag that they're "struggling in terms of emotional or behavioral functioning," Copeland says.
Here’s what parents should know.
What did the study look at?
The researchers studied 917 healthy children ages 2 to 6, who were getting routine pediatric care at Duke. Parents and caregivers answered questions about the child's eating habits and whether the child had symptoms of anxiety, depression, or other problems.
Based on the child's eating habits, the researchers labeled them as normal, moderate, or severe picky eaters, also called selective eaters.
"The children we’re talking about are not just misbehaving kids who refuse to eat their broccoli,” says Nancy Zucker, PhD, lead study author and director of the Duke Center for Eating Disorders, in a statement. “These are children whose eating has become so limited or selective that it’s starting to cause problems.”
What did the study find?
Eighteen percent of kids were considered moderate picky eaters, but only 3% were severe. Children with moderate and severe picky eating were more likely to show symptoms of depression and anxiety. Some symptoms of depression can be changes in patterns of eating and sleeping, as well as behavioral problems. Those with severe picky eating were more than twice as likely to have a formal diagnosis of depression or social anxiety.
