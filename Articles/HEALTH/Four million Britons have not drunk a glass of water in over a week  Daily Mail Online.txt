Only one in four Britons drink enough water and four million have not drunk a glass in over a week, research suggests.
Less than a quarter of adults regularly drink the recommended two litres of water a day, while one in seven admit drinking more alcohol than water.
Around half have a tea or coffee instead of water with 30 per cent saying 'they need caffeine more'.
And more than a third of Britons think water is boring.
The survey of 1,000 adults by SodaStream found that 27 per cent of people were unaware of the recommended daily water intake.
But people have felt the benefits, with 43 per cent saying that water makes them feel more energised and 40 per cent saying it improves their complexion.
More than half said they wished they drank more water.
GP Dr Ellie Cannon said: 'Water is the healthiest way to hydrate; it energises us, aids digestion and weight loss and improves the complexion to name just a few of the benefits.
'Despite this, many people are drinking far less than they should and their health could be suffering as a result.
'One in five GP visits in the UK are down to tiredness and fatigue. It is thought that dehydration could be a culprit in over 12 per cent of cases.
'Simple tricks like adding a little sparkle to your water can help encourage you to drink more water every day and you'll be feeling healthier and re-energised before you know it.'
Fiona Hope, managing director of SodaStream UK, added: 'The perception that water is boring isn't necessarily surprising, but it's worrying to see the extent people are neglecting such a vital part of their diet.'
