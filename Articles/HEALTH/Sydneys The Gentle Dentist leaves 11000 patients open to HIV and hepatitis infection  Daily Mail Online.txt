There is concern for more than 11,000 dental patients in Sydney who may have been left open to HIV and hepatitis infection over the past ten years.
Customers who visited The Gentle Dentist practices, which are located on Campsie and Sussex Street in Sydney's CBD, could have been exposed to hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV due to unclean equipment used in the surgeries, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.
It's believed seven dentists from The Gentle Dentist surgeries have been identified as being involved in the alleged malpractice, with four of them already suspended.

Sydney dentist Robert Starkenburg, who ran practices in Surry Hills and Bondi Junction, has also allegedly been contacted by the NSW Department of Health, who are informing patients of the outbreak.
The 75-year-old dentist told the Sydney Morning Herald he was 'a little lax' on enforcing regulations due to his age.
'In the last eight years, they have upgraded the protocols a lot,' he said.
'I was a little lax on getting the latest protocols ... [but] I have [since then] taken a couple of courses and taken steps to rectify the problem.'
It is understood the Department of Health will hold a press conference on the matter on Thursday.
