PE teachers see overweight children as less intelligent and less social | Daily Mail Online

A new study has found PE teachers have a 'strong anti-fat bias' with some saying being obese is 'pretty much worse than dying'.
So if you were fat at school and you thought your PE teacher bullied you, it might not have been all in your head.
According to Marita Lynagh, a senior lecturer at the University of Newcastle and author of the Journal of School Health, the study of 240 PE trainees and non-PE trainees found both had negative views towards obese children.
PE teachers were almost four times as likely to hold implicit negative beliefs about obese children, and almost three times as likely to think they were not as clever as other children, the Newcastle HeraldÂ reported.
'What we found was [the trainees] almost expect obese children not to not be good, even in things that don't have anything to do with physical activity,' Dr Lynagh told the paper.
'They actually expect the children to not be as good socially, or with things like reasoning skills, things that have nothing to do with weight'.
And while all the trainee teachers were less likely to admit to having anti-fat bias when they were asked about it, Dr Lynagh said she did make some concerning discoveries.
About 30 per cent of the participants in the study said being obese was 'one of the worst things that could happen to a child.
'In their view it was pretty much worse than dying,' she said.
