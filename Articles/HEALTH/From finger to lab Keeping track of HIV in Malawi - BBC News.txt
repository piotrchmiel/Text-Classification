From finger to lab: Keeping track of HIV in Malawi - BBC News

People living with HIV need to have the virus levels in their blood monitored to make sure their treatment is working.
But in remote areas, getting access to quick and reliable tests can be difficult.
Now Medecins Sans Frontieres has simplified the process of taking a drop of blood from the finger to the lab, so that people can get their results more quickly.
It is now being trialled in Thyolo district in southern Malawi, where roughly 15% of the population are HIV positive, as Lizzie Crouch reports.
