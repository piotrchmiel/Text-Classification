Saudi Arabian woman who has three 'TOENAIL HORNS' growing out of her foot  | Daily Mail Online


A pensioner has been left in agony after three bizarre toenail-like 'horns' sprouted from her foot - and continued to grow.
The unnamed woman's family say she is in incredible pain and and cannot sleep, let alone walk.
Her son told local media in Saudi Arabia: 'Nobody knows what it is. It looks like three toenails growing on the sole of her foot.
'It started a few years ago and has just got worse and worse.'
He added: 'We believe it was caused after a small piece of metal pierced her foot and remained inside, causing this bizarre condition.'
The woman, from the town of Wadi Al Dawasir in central Saudi Arabia's Riyadh Province, has reportedly been to several hospitals and clinics.
However her son claims none of them have been able to explain what she is suffering from.
Her desperate family are appealing for somebody to try and identify the condition and to operate so she can start walking again.
The son added: 'We call on health authorities to provide treatment for my mother who cannot sleep at night due to the pain, never mind walk properly.'

However one expert told MailOnline today the woman appeared to have a condition called cutaneous horns.
These are hard conical projections from the skin, made of compact keratin - the same tough protein found in fingernails and skin.
Cutaneous horns are so named as they resemble an animal’s horn.
And they could have been caused a reaction to a foreign body, such as the piece of metal the woman's son mentioned, suggests consultant podiatrist Michael O'Neill, of the College of Podiatry.


Treatment for this could be through clipping, or plastic surgery may be required, he said.
But he cautioned the growths 'could also turn out to be a nasty skin carcinoma [cancer] of some type'.
This would need to be confirmed with a biopsy before treatment began, he explained.
