Two women from Stevenage in Hertfordshire have backed a campaign to provide sanitary products for homeless women.
Sophie Harrold and Sanya Masood , both 24, have been collecting tampons and sanitary towels for a shelter in Liverpool.
They were inspired by the Homeless Period campaign which is calling for the government to provide free sanitary products for homeless women.
