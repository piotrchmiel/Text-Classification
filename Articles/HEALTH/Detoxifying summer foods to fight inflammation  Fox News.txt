Summer is all about warmer weather and fresh foods. It’s the perfect time of year to start eating nutrient-dense foods that fight inflammation. A decade of digging into the source of my illness has shown me that chronic inflammation is the root cause of many ailments.
Exposure to toxins (pesticides, cigarette smoke, alcohol, chemicals in processed foods, refined oils, refined salt and refined sugar), stress, lack of exercise and genetic predispositions can all contribute to inflammation. Learning how certain foods influence your inflammatory process is a wonderful way to reduce inflammation, increase your energy and keep you feeling young and vibrant.
My Anti-Inflammatory Grocery Guide lays out a list of foods that can help you maintain optimum health. It’s important to focus on vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, fiber and phytonutrients for decreased inflammation and increased energy. Remember that reducing inflammation is not just about what you eat. It’s about making lifestyle changes and creating an overall approach to a well-rounded low-stress lifestyle.
