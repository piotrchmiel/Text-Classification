Today's the big day. Maybe you've got a job interview lined up. Or you're having dinner with your future in-laws for the first time. Suddenly your heart races too fast or feels like it skipped a beat.
It's just the jitters, right? Could be. Sometimes, though, that thumping is a problem called atrial fibrillation, or AFib for short.
So how can you know? Your doctor has the final word, but there's a lot you can learn on your own if you pay attention to your ticker and what it's trying to tell you.

"We are not supposed to feel our heart beating, so when we become aware of it, it's usually because something is out of the ordinary," says Elsayed Soliman, MD.
That "something" is what doctors call heart palpitations. You might feel like it's fluttering, pounding, or skipping beats. Or it could seem like it's going too fast.
"Most people have felt it at one point or another, and it's not usually cause for alarm," Soliman says.
Sometimes, there are simple reasons. You might get palpitations if you drink caffeine or take a drug that makes you jumpy, like some cough or cold medicines. A tough workout, dehydration, or illness can also bring them on. So can drinking alcohol or a lack of sleep.
One of the most common causes of heart palpitations is anxiety. If you're nervous or stressed out, your brain releases hormones that can cause your heart to pound.
If anxiety is to blame, you may have some other symptoms too, says Ralph Sacco, MD, like sudden sweating or an upset stomach. You might even feel lightheaded or have trouble breathing.
Sometimes, Soliman says, you might not even realize that you're nervous. For instance, that racing heart you notice when you walk into your office each morning might be triggered by job stress, even if you tell yourself that everything is under control.
Overall, few palpitations are caused by serious heart conditions. But sometimes they're a symptom of AFib. It could be dangerous if you don't get treatment.
