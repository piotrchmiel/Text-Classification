The struggle of being a parent with multiple sclerosis - BBC News

6 August 2015 Last updated at 07:38 BST
What is it like to be a disabled parent with a young child?
Nicola Smith, who has multiple sclerosis (MS), has told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she is worried her condition will lead her six-year-old son, Finlay, to miss out.
She told the programme that because of the tiredness the condition can cause, everyday parenting tasks like taking her son to school can also make her feel "like you've run a marathon".
