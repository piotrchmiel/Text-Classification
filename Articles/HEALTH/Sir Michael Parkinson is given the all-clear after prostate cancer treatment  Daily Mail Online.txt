Sir Michael Parkinson is given the all-clear after prostate cancer treatment | Daily Mail Online

Sir Michael Parkinson has revealed that he has been given the all-clear after treatment for prostate cancer.
The veteran broadcaster, 80, has been battling the disease for two years.
However, he has been left needing blood transfusions every six to seven weeks because the radiation treatment he received has reduced his red blood cell count.
Sir Michael, who is president of the Lord Taverner’s charity, was speaking at the London Motorsport Festival earlier this week.
He said: ‘I have been given the all clear but then they keep on testing you. They have got rid of the cancer – but they can never be totally sure of it.
‘The consequence of my radiation treatment is that I have to have blood transfusions but the periods in between again I feel fairly well.’
He added: ‘I eat fairly sensibly and I drink very rarely. I have the odd glass of beer.’
Sir Michael, affectionately known as Parky, interviewed around 2,000 celebrities over four decades, ranging from Madonna to Muhammad Ali.
He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in May 2013 and went public with the news in July of that year.
Since then he has worked to raise awareness of the disease, launching a campaign urging men to check for warning signs.
