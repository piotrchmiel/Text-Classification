Stem Cells: Call for Black and Asian donors - BBC News

4 August 2015 Last updated at 09:05 BST
Stem cells can change the lives of people with serious diseases as they have the ability to become virtually any human tissue.
However the cells can only be of benefit if a matching donor is found, which poses a problem for patients from Black, Asian and minority ethnic heritage.
Fewer registered donors from these backgrounds mean there is far less hope of finding a match.
