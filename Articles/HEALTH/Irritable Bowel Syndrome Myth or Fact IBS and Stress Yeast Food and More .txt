Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Myth or Fact? IBS and Stress, Yeast, Food, and More 


Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can be tough to understand, even for the millions of Americans who have it. There’s a still lot of confusion about what it is and how best to treat it. So it’s easy for misconceptions about the condition to sound like facts. If you or your loved one has IBS, here’s what you should know about nine of the most common myths out there.

Experts don’t know what causes the disease. What they do know, though, is that “Even though stress and depression can make symptoms worse, IBS is not a psychiatric illness. It’s not caused by emotions or thoughts,” says Arun Swaminath, MD, director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.
Take it from Julianna Corso Eldemire, who was diagnosed in 2012. “I was always told that IBS only affects people who are high strung or who have high anxiety, which makes their bodies react in a painful way,” says Eldemire, 26, of Boca Raton, FL. “Since I have a stress-free personality and don’t sweat the small stuff, at first I didn’t like being put in that category.” Now she tells anyone who misunderstands that IBS is a real medical condition, not something that’s “all in her head.”
“There’s no research to prove that a sensitivity to yeast [in foods like bread and beer] causes IBS,” Swaminath says. The same is true for candida overgrowth. Candida is a fungus that naturally grows in your gut. Some medical experts think having too much of it can lead to IBS. They say that people can cut out yeast and sugar to reduce the fungus and improve their symptoms. But until studies show a real link between IBS and candida, the jury is still out. If you think yeast or carbohydrates make your condition worse, talk to your doctor or a dietitian who specializes in gut health to figure out what you can do.
