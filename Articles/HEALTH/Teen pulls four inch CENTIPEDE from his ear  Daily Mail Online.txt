Teen pulls four inch CENTIPEDE from his ear | Daily Mail Online


After waking up with excruciating pain in one ear, an Arkansas teenager decide to investigate.
Feeling something strange in his ear, Grant Botti,14, said he reached in and pulled out the culprit: a four-inch long centipede.
Botti's mother, Angela Botti, placed the centipede, still alive, in a plastic bag and took the teen, of Saline County, to the emergency room, KATVÂ reports.
A doctor found small abrasions in Botti's ear drum. He was treated and released.
Angela told KATV that they don't know where the critter came from, but Botti had recently been swimming outdoors.
Saline Memorial doctors and nurses said that they have seen people come in with all sorts of things in their ears, but never a centipede -- until now.
