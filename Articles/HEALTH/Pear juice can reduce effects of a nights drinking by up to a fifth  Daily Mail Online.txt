Pear juice can reduce effects of a night's drinking by up to a fifth | Daily Mail Online

Eating a juicy pear before a night of heavy drinking could help alleviate the effects of a hangover, scientists claim.
Researchers say those who are suffering from the consequences of the evening before could feel up to 21 per cent better thanks to the fruit's juice.
It helps increase concentration, reduces memory loss and even decreases the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream, according to Australian government scientists.

Pears also reduce a person's sensitivity to light and sound.
The only type of pear tested in the study was the Asian, or nashi pear, which is available in British supermarkets, but researchers are now planning to widen their scope to see whether varieties of Western pear produce the same results.
According to scientists employed by CISRO, the Australian government's scientific research organisation, to reduce the effects of a hangover you need to either drink 220ml of pear juice or eat a whole pear before consuming alcohol.
Lead researcher Manny Noakes said the theory behind the finding was that Asian pears acted upon the key enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism.
She said: 'Overall hangover severity, as measured by a 14 item hangover severity scale, was significantly reduced in the Korean (Asian) pear group compared with those having a placebo drink, with the most pronounced effect seen on the specific symptom of "trouble concentrating".
'The effect was only demonstrated if pears were consumed before alcohol consumption.
'There is no evidence that you can consume pears after drinking and avoid a hangover. And remember, the very best way to not get a hangover is to not drink in the first place.'
Ms Noakes said researchers were now planning to carry out more studies to see whether other varieties of pears had similar hangover effects.
