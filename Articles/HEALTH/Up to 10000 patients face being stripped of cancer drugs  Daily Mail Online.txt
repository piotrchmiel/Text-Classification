Up to 10,000 patients face 'being stripped of cancer drugs' | Daily Mail Online

Up to 10,500 cancer patients could be denied life-extending drugs under secret plans to slash the Government’s flagship fund.
In meetings held behind closed doors last week, officials discussed removing up to 37 treatments from the Cancer Drugs Fund list because it is running out of money.
This is more than half of the drugs currently provided and includes treatments for breast, prostate, bowel, skin and lung cancer which are the last resort for terminally ill patients.
Officials are looking to restrict the number of treatments routinely provided as the fund keeps going over budget.
The scheme was launched in 2011 to pay for medicines and procedures deemed too expensive for NHS funding.
It was a key policy in David Cameron’s 2010 election manifesto, and the Prime Minister said at the time that patients should no longer be denied drugs on cost grounds.
Since its launch four years ago it has benefited 50,500 patients, including 24,600 last year alone.
Initially in 2011 its budget was capped at £200million, but this has risen to £340million as there has been so much demand.
The scheme includes a list of 65 approved treatments which are automatically available, and doctors can apply for money to pay for other drugs. But last Wednesday and Thursday, meetings were held between NHS England, doctors and patient representatives to consider removing 37 treatments from the automatic approval list.
Bevacizumab (Avastin): Treats an aggressive form of breast cancer known as ‘triple negative’ and has improved survival rates by up to a third.
The drug can also be used for bowel cancer, giving an extra three years of life in some cases. For cervical cancer patients it has extended survival time by four months.
Radium 223 therapy: Radiotherapy injections which can give prostate cancer patients an extra six months of life.
Everolimus: Can extend survival by four months for breast cancer patients.
Abiraterone: Used to treat prostate cancer and can add an extra four months to a patient’s life.
Vandetanib: Trials have shown the drug can increase survival rates among thyroid cancer patients by 50 per cent.
Ibrutinib: Used to treat leukaemia, and has been shown to increase survival rates by up to 78 per cent.
If all are taken off, an estimated 10,500 patients would be denied drugs next year.
Last night campaigners accused NHS bosses of ‘cutting lives short’. Andrew Wilson, chief executive of the Rarer Cancers Foundation said: ‘This process is a shambles and it is harming patients.
‘Thousands of desperately ill cancer patients could lose out. The NHS should be focusing on improving the system not introducing knee-jerk cuts.’
Mark Flannagan, chief executive of Beating Bowel Cancer, said: ‘We’re extremely concerned further cutbacks to the Cancer Drugs Fund will compromise the NHS’s ability to provide the best treatment choices for advanced bowel cancer patients ... and ultimately cut lives short.’
Britain’s cancer survival rates are considerably lower than those elsewhere in Europe –partly because patients often miss out on cutting-edge drugs.
Among the treatments facing the axe is one for advanced bowel cancer which has quadrupled survival time from just eight months to three years.
Samia al Qadhi, chief executive of Breast Cancer Care, said terminally ill patients were ‘being subjected to huge emotional distress from this relentless back and forth over availability of treatments’. The discussions to cut further drugs come just three months after officials axed 25 treatments from the list.
Separately, talks have been held between the Department of Health and the pharmaceutical industry to discuss cutting next year’s Cancer Drugs Fund pot by £40million.
A spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has insisted there are no current plans to reduce the budget.
This autumn, NHS England is expected to unveil plans setting out exactly how the Cancer Drugs Fund will be reformed.
One option under consideration is to use it as a ‘dry run’, with drugs being available through the scheme for a set period while they are assessed by NHS rationing body Nice.
An NHS England spokesperson said: ‘A decision has not yet been taken – it would be wrong to pre-empt the outcome of the Cancer Drugs Fund panel.’
