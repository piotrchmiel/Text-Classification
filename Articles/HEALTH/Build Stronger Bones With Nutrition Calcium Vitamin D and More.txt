Build Stronger Bones With Nutrition: Calcium, Vitamin D, and More


When you eat right, you strengthen your bones and lower your odds of getting a disease that makes them weaker and more likely to break (osteoporosis). The best strategy is to keep a few key nutrients in mind when you plan your meals.

If you don't get enough, your bones may get weaker, which can lead to fractures. Many adults need 1,000 mg per day. If you're a woman over 50, bump that up to 1,200 mg. A man over 70? Ditto.
The problem is, your body doesn't make calcium on its own. You need to get it from other sources. Food, rather than pills, is the best way to get some. Choose from these groups:
Make sure you get enough dairy. It's a surefire way to protect against osteoporosis, says Rene Ficek, RD, a nutrition expert at Seattle Sutton's Healthy Eating.
Cow's milk is a great source of calcium. One cup has 300 mg. That's about one-third of the daily recommended amount.
You can also get calcium from cheese and yogurt.
Not a fan of dairy products? Instead of cow's milk, try some made from almonds, rice, or soy.
Check the nutrition labels carefully. Rice milk can have anywhere from 20-250 mg of calcium per serving, says Toby Smithson, RDN, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Soy milks vary between 35-300 mg per serving.
You can also get calcium by eating things like:
Or try food that has it added in. It will say "calcium-fortified" on the label. Some choices are:
For drinks, always shake the container. The calcium may have settled to the bottom.
A supplement can help if you can't get enough calcium from your diet. Ask your doctor how much is right for you.
It's also important for strong bones. Your body needs it to absorb calcium.
