Teen admissions for high blood pressure treble in ten years amid salt concerns | Daily Mail Online

Rising numbers of children are being treated in hospital for high blood pressure over concerns they are eating too much salt, figures reveal.
Admissions have trebled in the last ten years and include almost 400 children under five.
The figures, obtained by Channel 4’s Dispatches from 29 NHS trusts, show that 1,064 children under 16 were admitted to hospital for high blood pressure between 2012 and 2014.
Of the trusts who broke admissions down into age groups, 391 children were aged 0 to five, 197 six to ten and 429 11 to 16.
And data from ten NHS trusts going back a decade show admissions have trebled in that time, showing that a total of 153 children were admitted and treated in 2014, compared to just 49 in 2004.
The hospitals could not confirm whether the high blood pressure was caused by excess salt or obesity, and in some cases it may be due to conditions affecting the kidneys or heart.
But separate research found that half of all seven-year-olds have too much salt in their diet.
Children of this age are only meant to eat a maximum of 5g of salt a day – but a quarter were found to be consuming more than 6.7g.
The study by the University of Bristol tracked 6,000 children from the ages of seven through to 15 and found much of the salt came from processed foods such as pizza.
It also showed that the children who exceeded the recommended salt intake all had high blood pressure at the ages of seven, nine, and 15 – by which stage it was two points above average.
This difference in adults is linked to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes.
Dr Kate Northstone, senior research fellow who was involved in the study said: ‘We were able to look over time, so can show that salt intake in childhood has medium and potentially long-term effects on cardiovascular health.’
The Dispatches documentary also revealed that out of the 73 food companies that signed up to a voluntary Government pledge to cut salt levels, just 12 have actually met the targets set.
