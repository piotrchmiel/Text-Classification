CLEVELAND –  A spokeswoman for a Cleveland hospital says a woman has died from complications of community-acquired Legionnaires' disease.
Alicia Reale of the University Hospitals Case Medical Center says the 53-year-old Brunswick woman died Thursday morning from the disease.
A spokeswoman from the Medina County Health Department says the agency is working with infection control specialists and the woman's medical team to determine the source of the disease. No other information was released.
Her death comes as New York City is grappling with its largest-ever outbreak of Legionnaires' disease. It's a form of pneumonia caused by breathing in mist contaminated with the Legionella bacteria. Ten people have died and more than 100 people have been diagnosed there.
People can get exposed to the bacteria from a variety of sources.
