A 31-year old man who lost the use of his legs in 2013 after being diagnosed with a functional neurological disorder, has described the "incredible feeling" of walking with robotic legs.
Simon Kindleysides walked alongside Jon Graham from the firm that developed the equipment, on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.
His brother, Shaun Lake, was seeing it for the first time.
"It's a great feeling... to feel this tall... and to experience taking steps. It's just incredible," he said.
