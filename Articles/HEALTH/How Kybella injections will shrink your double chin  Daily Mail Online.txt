How Kybella injections 'will shrink your double chin' | Daily Mail Online

Help is on hand for that curse of middle age, the double chin.
Experts have developed a drug which can be injected into the chin to destroy fat cells.
The treatment, called Kybella, has been approved for use in the US by the Food and Drug Administration. But British clinics are already creating waiting lists for the drug in the hope that is licensed for use in the UK.
The drug - which costs $300 (£192) per injection - was developed by experts at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre in Dallas.
With at least two or three injections used per session, and each treatment needing between two and four sessions, the cost could easily run to £2,000 or more.
Professor Jeffrey Kenkel, a plastic surgeon who has already used it on patients, said: 'Kybella is identical to a deoxycholic acid, which is naturally produced by the body to absorb fat.
'Kybella takes advantage of that fat-destroying activity to help eliminate the fat below the chin.
'This provides a new option to consider for those who are not ready for a surgical fix, but are looking for an answer as to how to get rid of fat beneath the chin.'
The procedure, available on an outpatient basis, involves a series of injections into the chin.
Most patients will return to the clinic between two and four times, a month apart, to achieve the desired outcome.

Cosmedics UK, a chain of skin clinics with branches on Harley Street and across the UK, is already advertising the treatment.
The British firm says on its website: 'Please contact us to be put on the waiting list for this exciting new treatment.'
