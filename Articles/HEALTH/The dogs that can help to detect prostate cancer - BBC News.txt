Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer found in men, with over 100 people diagnosed every day.
However, current tests to identify it are highly inaccurate, giving false positives, and leading to unnecessary and painful operations.
Now, in the first clinical trial in Britain, specially trained dogs will be used to see whether cancer can be detected more effectively.
Claire Guest co-founded Medical Detection Dogs, the charity which is running the trial.
She said the dogs can pick up changes in scent that could lead to a cancer diagnosis.
