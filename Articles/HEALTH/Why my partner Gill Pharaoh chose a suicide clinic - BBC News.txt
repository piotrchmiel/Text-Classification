A retired nurse from London who travelled to Switzerland to end her life disliked the "indignity" of ageing, her partner has said.
Gill Pharaoh, 75, was apparently healthy when she made the decision to go to the Lifecircle clinic in Basel.
Campaigners against assisted dying have described the case as "chilling".
But her partner John Southall told the BBC that her quality of life had deteriorated and she lived in fear of having a stroke.
''She had a very busy life... it went rapidly downhill,'' he said.
