The Indian government is not publishing the results of a vast national survey of the health of the country's citizens.
The last time the nation published comprehensive figures on health was in 2007.
The BBC has seen the report, which highlights the poor health of citizens in Gujarat, the state which was run by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi before he took national office.
