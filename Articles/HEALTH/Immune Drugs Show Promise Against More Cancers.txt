June 29, 2015 -- Medicines that help our immune system fight off tumors are showing early success in a widening variety of cancers.
Some of the drugs, known as immunotherapy, have already been approved to treat several cancers, including advanced melanoma and a type of lung cancer. Studies have shown they can help treat not only tumors such as those in breast and colon cancer, but also blood cancers like multiple myeloma and Hodgkin lymphoma.
The drugs are expensive, and experts caution they're far from a cure. Still, hundreds of studies are underway to test how effective they are. Researchers recently talked about some of these studies at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference:
Also, two early studies presented in December at the American Society of Hematology meeting found Opdivo shows promise in people with Hodgkin lymphoma who'd tried other treatments, including stem cell transplants, without success.
"It’s looking like there’s no type of cancer in which some patient won’t benefit from these immune approaches,” says Richard Schilsky, MD, chief medical officer at the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Immunotherapy for cancer is not a new idea. It made the cover of Time magazine back in 1973.
But “despite all of the efforts... there were really no significant breakthroughs that made a real difference in the lives of patients with cancer,” says Len Lichtenfeld, MD, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. He worked at the National Cancer Institute in the early 1970s.
