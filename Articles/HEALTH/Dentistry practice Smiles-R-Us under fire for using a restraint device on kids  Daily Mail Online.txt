Dentistry practice Smiles-R-Us under fire for using a restraint device on kids | Daily Mail Online

A Georgia dentistry practice is under fire for using a controversial restraint device on children during oral procedures - although they insist hat parents all sign consent forms allowing them to use it.
Smiles-R-Us in Carrollton, Georgia run by Dr. Jamey Chung uses what's called a 'papoose board' to hold down 'uncooperative' children while they are undergoing dental work.
Father James Crow said that when he and his mother took his daughter Elizabeth to the dentist to get her front tooth pulled they heard screaming as they sat in the waiting room but were told that they were not allowed to see her.

'We were sitting out in the waiting room and all of a sudden, we heard somebody screaming,' Elizabeth's grandmother Evelyn Crow said.
When James Crow made his way into the exam room he saw he child strapped to the table with no one to attend to her.
'I couldn’t see my kid in the body bag just strapped down to the bed, I couldn’t handle it,' Evelyn Crow said.
WSBTV spoke with a spokesperson with the Georgia Board of Dentistry that there are no rules against using restraints though there are warnings that they could inflict possible physical or psychological harm.
Elizabeth's grandmother furiously asked the medical office why they used the papoose board and they said it was because Elizabeth was 'not cooperating.'
She said she thought they were just going to give her child laughing gas and that she thinks there should be a law restricting dentists from using restraints.
The Crows signed a consent form but they claim they did not authorize the device to be used.
