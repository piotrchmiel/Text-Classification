Aug. 5, 2015 -- A stomach illness linked to Mexican cilantro contaminated by human waste has been diagnosed in more than 380 people in 26 states, according to the U.S. government.
The outbreak of the intestinal infection cyclosporiasis that appears to have started after May 1 is being investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration, the Associated Press reported.
The infection causes diarrhea, nausea and fatigue that can last for weeks to month if untreated.
The contamination on the Mexican cilantro may be the result of "contact with the parasite shed from the intestinal tract of humans" in growing fields, contaminated water, or during processing and packaging, the FDA said.
The agency said preliminary findings suggest that cases of infection among people in Texas and Wisconsin can be linked to cilantro from the state of Puebla, Mexico, the AP reported.
Cilantro from Puebla was linked to outbreaks of the stomach illness in the U.S. in 2012, 2013 and 2014, according to the FDA.
