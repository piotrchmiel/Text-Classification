For the first time, more than 18,000 children have been asked what they really think about hospitals. The questions ranged from what food they eat, through to how they would rate their level of care.
The survey, by the Care Quality Commission, found that while the vast majority of children felt safe in hospital, many said they were not given enough information or attention from staff.
The BBC's Jayne McCubbin has been to Birmingham Children's Hospital to find out more.
