Patients died as a direct result of their poor care at a home at the centre of the UK's biggest inquiry into alleged neglect, a panel has found.
The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) panel also said the actions of five nurses at Brithdir Care Home, near Bargoed, amounted to misconduct.
Cases were proven against Tembakazi Moyana, Rachel Tanta, Daphne Richards, Susan Greening and Beverley Mock. Misconduct charges were not proved against a sixth nurse, Rachel Pritchard.
