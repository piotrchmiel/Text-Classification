Washington motel closes after possible outbreak of Legionnaires' disease | Fox News

LACEY, Wash. –  Thurston County health officials say a Super 8 Motel in Lacey has voluntarily closed while officials investigate a possible outbreak of Legionnaires' disease.
Over the past month, three cases of the disease have been confirmed with a possible connection to the motel.
The disease is a serious form of pneumonia that is caused by the Legionella bacteria. People get it when they breathe in water mist or vapor that has been contaminated with the bacteria. The time period for the illness is two to 10 days.
Some hotel whirlpools, showers and air conditioners have been found to be sources of the disease.
Health officials say symptoms include fever, body aches, cough and chest pain.
County health officials are contacting former guests at the motel to inform them about the outbreak.
