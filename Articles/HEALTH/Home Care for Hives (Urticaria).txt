Home Care for Hives (Urticaria)


Hives are itchy and uncomfortable. When you have chronic hives, you deal with them for weeks at a time with no end in sight. Your goal is to find relief, even just in the short term.
Medications help, but lifestyle changes can make you more comfortable, too.

Some people get new hives from scratching their skin, and when it’s dry, it’s itchy. To help keep moisture in:
“Soaps aren’t generally thought to cause hives, but some soaps can be really drying,” says Matthew A. Molenda, MD, a dermatologist with ProMedica Physicians Dermatology in Toledo, Ohio.
When you break out, soothe the area with cool compresses to shrink the blood vessels and bring down swelling, says Rauno Joks, MD, associate professor of clinical medicine at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, NY.
Hives come from a reaction inside the body, so creams and salves don’t help to get rid of them, Joks says. But you may get relief from anti-itch products such as 1% menthol in aqueous cream.
A study found that over time, a daily high dose of vitamin D helped some with their hives. But it won’t take the place of your medication, so talk to your doctor before starting any supplements.
Some things people do or take every day can cause a reaction.
