Your gastric band could make you have lower alcohol tolerance | Daily Mail Online

People who have gastric bypass surgery to lose weight have a lower tolerance for alcohol, doctors have warned.
The weight-loss surgery involves an operation to make people feel full quicker.
Doctors connect a small pouch at the top of the stomach to the intestine - and as soon as the pouch fills up the patient will stop eating.
But experts at Washington University in St Louis, found that patients who undergo the surgery also deal with alcohol in a different way.
Because it is bypassing the stomach, it enters the bloodstream more quickly, resulting in earlier and higher peaks in blood-alcohol levels.
The researchers, whose work was published in the journal JAMA Surgery, found that women who consumed the equivalent of two drinks in a short period of time had blood-alcohol contents similar to women who had consumed four drinks but had not had the operation.
The findings are relevant for the rapidly increasing number of British patients who are now eligible for weight-loss surgery, following changes to NHS rules last year.
Anyone who has type 2 diabetes and is above a certain weight is now eligible for bariatric surgery - an estimated two million Britons.
Gastric bypass operations are among the most common of these procedures.
Yanina Pepino, who led the study of 17 obese women, said: ‘The findings tell us we need to warn patients who have gastric bypass surgery that they will experience changes in the way their bodies metabolize alcohol.
‘Consuming alcohol after surgery could put patients at risk for potentially serious problems, even if they consume only moderate amounts of alcohol.’
Although the study included only women, the researchers think men who have gastric bypass surgery are likely to have similar changes in how their bodies metabolize alcohol.
