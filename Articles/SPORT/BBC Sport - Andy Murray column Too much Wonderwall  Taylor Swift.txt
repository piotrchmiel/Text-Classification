It's great to have some British company in the third round of Wimbledon and 
    

James Ward isn't finished yet 


     - he can compete at this level.
It makes a big difference when all the players are supporting each other and it's not negative or bitchy, and I try to help with that.
Everybody should be backing each other rather than thinking, 'I don't want him to do well because that takes my spot'.
Fortunately we get on well and if we can help each other to do better, that's great.
I've had Wardy, Kyle Edmund, Jamie Baker and Oli Golding out for training blocks with me in Miami and I think it benefits all of us.
It's not about saying I want James to get to 90 in the world; I just want each of them to get to their potential.
Not everyone has the capability to get to 100 or 50 or 20, but if they show they're doing everything they can when I practise with them, that they're going to be disciplined and they want to work hard, then I want to spend time and train with them.
I care about the game and I want as many of them as possible to do well.
I haven't always known the guys that well when they've come out to Florida but I've wanted to try and help some of the younger ones in particular. It's motivation for me.
I remember when I was young and used to 
    

practise with Tim Henman 


     or Greg Rusedski, I loved doing that. It was great and I feel as though playing with a younger British guy made them want to show me the right work ethic, the discipline, and how committed you need to be.
