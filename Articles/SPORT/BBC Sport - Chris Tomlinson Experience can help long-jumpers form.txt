Middlesbrough long-jumper Chris Tomlinson says experience can help him return to top form at this weekend's British Championships in Birmingham.
The 33-year-old has failed to exceed eight metres so far in 2015, although he came close with 7.96m at the British Grand Prix last month.
The Teessider is seeking the World qualifying distance of 8.10 metres.
"When my back has been against the wall I've turned it round as a relentless competitor," Tomlinson told BBC Tees.
"Physically I'm in great shape. At 33, I'm running faster than ever, I'm stronger, jumping better but unfortunately not that is not going over into competition yet.
"I've had a few bad injuries at bad times and I think I would have gelled and jumped further but it's a rhythmical event and you need to find that rhythm.
"Hopefully this weekend I can do that."
Having split from coach Rana Reider last year, Tomlinson continues to train back in his native north east, as well as competing at events such as the North Yorkshire and South Durham meeting in Middlesbrough on Tuesday.
He faces competition from Olympic, European and Commonwealth champion Greg Rutherford and Dan Bramble for a spot in the Great Britain team, both of whom are also competing in Birmingham.
"It's like anyone who plays sport, says a golfer, sometimes you can get the shanks, even if you've got great golf shots you can't execute," Tomlinson added.
"At the moment it's been a bit like that, my technique has reverted back to what I was doing as an 18-year-old.
"I need to address those issue an it's more mental than physical, it's my 14th season now."
