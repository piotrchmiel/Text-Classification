Carlos Beltran joins Jacoby Ellsbury on Yanks' disabled list

NEW YORK (AP) -- Carlos Beltran has been put on the 15-day disabled list by the New York Yankees because a strained left oblique muscle.
New York made the move before Friday's homestand opener against Tampa Bay and said it was retroactive to Wednesday.
The Yankees already are missing starting centerfielder Jacoby Ellsbury, who has been slow to heal from a knee injury that has kept him on the disabled list since May 20. Ellsbury played with Class A Tampa on Monday and Wednesday in the start of a minor league rehabilitation assignment.
New York recalled outfielder Ramon Flores and infielder Gregorio Petit from Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and optioned outfielder Taylor Dugas to the Triple-A team.
