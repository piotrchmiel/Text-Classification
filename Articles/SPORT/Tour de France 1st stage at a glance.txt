Tour de France 1st stage at a glance

UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) -- A brief look at the 1st stage of the Tour de France on Saturday:
Stage: A flat and windy 13.8-kilometer (8.6-mile) individual time trial through cycling-mad Dutch city of Utrecht, where fans jam-packed the streets to roar on each rider.
Winner: Australian rider Rohan Dennis clinched his first Tour stage win in style, setting a record speed for a Tour time trial.
Yellow jersey: Dennis is the first Australian to wear the leader's jersey since veteran Simon Gerrans two years ago.
Quote of the day: ''I don't want to be a one-hit wonder. I want to hold it for at least one more day,'' - Dennis on what it means to wear the famed yellow jersey.
Stat of the day: 55.446 kph (34.4 mph) - The average speed for Dennis during his record-breaking time trial.
Next stage: Sunday's 2nd stage stays in the Netherlands, starting from Utrecht before ending 166 kilometers (103 miles) later at the heart of the Zeeland Delta. Cycling along the Dutch coastline promises to be tricky, with heavy gusts and sprays.
