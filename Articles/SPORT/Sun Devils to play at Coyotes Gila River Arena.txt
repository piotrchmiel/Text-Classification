The Sun Devils and Coyotes made a joint announcement Wednesday that Arizona State will face Arizona's club team on Oct. 7 and two games during a four-team tournament at the arena in Glendale.
The Desert Hockey Classic, Jan. 8-10, will include the Sun Devils, Connecticut, Yale and Michigan Tech. Arizona State also will play the U.S. Under-18 National Team on Feb. 28.
Arizona State announced last November that it will join Division I hockey for the 2015-16 and play 25 games against Division I opponents.  The Sun Devils won the national club team title in 2013-14.
