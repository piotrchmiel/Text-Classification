BBC Sport - Argentina v Chile

Coverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website
Argentina's Lionel Messi says his star-studded team are "desperate" to mark their status by winning the Copa America final against hosts Chile.
The 2014 beaten World Cup finalists have not won a major trophy in 22 years.
"This generation is desperate to win a title with the national team," said 28-year-old Barcelona forward Messi.
"As a team, we deserve to win something and it would mean so much after the World Cup where we came so close."
Argentina's squad includes Sergio Aguero, Javier Mascherano, Angel Di Maria, Carlos Tevez and Gonzalo Higuain.
"If this generation of players don't win anything we're going to regret it for the rest of our lives," said Aguero of Manchester City.
La Albiceleste will join Uruguay as the most successful side in the tournament's history if they win a 14th Copa America title.
In contrast, Chile, whose line-up includes Alexis Sanchez and Arturo Vidal, are aiming to win the tournament for the first time having finished as runners-up four times.
The hosts have also never beaten Argentina at the Copa America in 24 attempts, but some tickets are being sold for nearly Â£15,000 for the game at the Estadio Nacional in Santiago.
"For a lot of people, it would be enough to have reached the final," said Chile's Barcelona keeper Claudio Bravo. "What could be better than winning the Copa America playing at home?"
