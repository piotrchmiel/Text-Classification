Results and fixtures
England came from behind to beat Jamaica 54-50 to stay top of Pool B at the Netball World Cup in Sydney.
An error-strewn first half left England five points behind, but they recovered in an exhilarating third quarter to lead 39-37 with 15 minutes to go.
And the world number three side held their nerve to seal a four-goal victory, to keep them on course to progress as group winners.
Earlier on, group rivals 
        Scotland

     secured a 47-36 win over 
        Samoa.
England will be favourites to beat Samoa on Sunday (07:20 BST) in their final group game and should they finish top, Tracey Neville's side will avoid a meeting with holders and hosts Australia in the next round.
Scotland play their final game against second-placed Jamaica on Monday at 10:20 BST.
