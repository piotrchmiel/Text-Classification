Saturday's match against Andreas Seppi was a tough one but I got through it, and the crowd on Centre Court really made a difference.
I feel like I'm playing well right now and can't wait for the second week. I'll be back on Centre Court on Monday but before the action starts again, I thought I'd use this column to answer some of the questions you sent using Twitter and Facebook.
Q) What did Seppi say to you to make you laugh at the end?

     (John Parsons)
I didn't really hear exactly what he said, but he said it and then laughed, so I laughed as well.
