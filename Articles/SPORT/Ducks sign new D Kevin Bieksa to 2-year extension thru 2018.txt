ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Defenseman Kevin Bieksa has agreed to a two-year, $8 million contract extension through 2018 with the Anaheim Ducks.
The Ducks announced the deal with Bieksa on Thursday, two days after the club acquired him from Vancouver.
Bieksa has one year and $4.6 million left on his contract from the Canucks. He scored 14 points in 60 games for Vancouver last season.
Anaheim acquired Bieksa shortly after general manager Bob Murray determined he couldn't re-sign defenseman Francois Beauchemin, who got a three-year deal worth $13.5 million from Colorado.
Bieksa will be the Ducks' highest-paid defenseman next season. His salary for the following two seasons will match defenseman Cam Fowler's annual $4 million deal.
