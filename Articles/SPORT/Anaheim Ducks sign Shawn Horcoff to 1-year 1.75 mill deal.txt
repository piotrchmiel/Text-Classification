Anaheim Ducks sign Shawn Horcoff to 1-year, $1.75 mill deal

ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Veteran center Shawn Horcoff has agreed to a one-year, $1.75 million deal with the Anaheim Ducks.
The Ducks announced the deal Friday.
Horcoff had 29 points and a plus-9 rating in 76 games for the Dallas Stars last season.
The speedy Michigan State product spent the past two seasons in Dallas after beginning his NHL career with 12 seasons for the Edmonton Oilers, earning an All-Star game appearance and playing in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final.
Anaheim needed a veteran center because Nate Thompson could be out for six months after undergoing postseason surgery last month on his left shoulder. Thompson played through two labral tears while the Ducks finished one game short of the Stanley Cup Final.
Horcoff will turn 37 years old in September.
