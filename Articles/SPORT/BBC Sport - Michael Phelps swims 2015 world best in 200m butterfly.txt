Venue: Kazan, Russia Dates: 2-9 August
Coverage: Live on BBC Two, Radio 5 live sports extra, online, tablets, mobiles and BBC Sport app.
Olympic swimming great Michael Phelps clocked the fastest 200m butterfly time in the world this year at the USA National Championships.
Phelps, 30, 
    
served a six-month ban 

     and was excluded from the World Championships by USA Swimming after a drink-drive conviction in December.
But the all-time most decorated Olympian won in one minute 52.94 seconds in San Antonio, Texas.
"Anything is possible if you do want something bad enough," he said.
Phelps, who has 22 Olympic medals, was winning his ninth national title in the event and 54th overall.
If he had been allowed to swim at the World Championships taking place in Russia, that time - his fastest 200m butterfly for six years - would have won by 0.54 seconds.
"It's good to do it on my own shore in the country that I represent," he said.
"I went through a lot, and to be able to train like I did to get ready for this and do that, I can do whatever I put my mind to."
