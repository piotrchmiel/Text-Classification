Venue: Headingley Stadium Date: Friday, 3 July Kick-off: 20:00 BST Coverage: Commentary on BBC Radio Leeds, BBC Radio Merseyside and live scores on the BBC Sport website.
Leeds are set to give a debut to 
    

new signing Mitch Garbutt, 


     less than a week after he arrived from Brisbane Broncos.
Fellow front rower Adam Cuthbertson (calf) and half-back Danny McGuire (ankle), who missed the Challenge Cup win at Hull are back.
Joe Greenwood is available for St Helens after being cleared of dangerous contact in the match against Widnes.
Saints have named the same squad that beat the Vikings to progress to the Challenge Cup semi-final.
St Helens head coach Keiron Cunningham told BBC Radio Merseyside:
"They don't come much tougher than Leeds at Leeds.
"The thing we've got on our side is that we genuinely enjoy going over to Headingley and we've had some right ding dongs there.
"It is a good place to play as they always have a good following and we generally take a lot of support over there."
