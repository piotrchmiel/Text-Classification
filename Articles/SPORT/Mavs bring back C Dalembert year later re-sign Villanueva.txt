Mavs bring back C Dalembert year later, re-sign Villanueva

DALLAS (AP) -- The Mavericks signed free-agent center Samuel Dalembert on Thursday for a second stint in Dallas, and re-signed forward Charlie Villanueva.
Dalembert started 68 of his 80 games for Dallas during the 2013-14 season, averaging 6.6 points and 6.8 rebounds while playing 20 minutes per game. He was part of a multiplayer trade that sent him to the New York Knicks after last season.
Dalembert, the only Haitian-born player in the NBA, has averaged 7.7 points and 7.8 rebounds in 886 career games with Philadelphia, Sacramento, Houston, Milwaukee, Dallas and New York.
In 64 games for Dallas last season, Villanueva averaged 6.3 points and 2.3 rebounds while making 38 percent of his 3-pointers (83 of 221).
