
Derby County have signed Hull City winger Tom Ince for a club record fee, understood to be around £4.75m.
The 23-year-old scored 11 goals in 18 games while 
    

on loan at the Rams last season 


     and becomes the sixth player to join this summer.
Darren Bent, Alex Pearce, Scott Carson, Chris Baird and Andreas Weimann have already joined prior to 
    

Paul Clement's first season as head coach.
"He is an exciting talent. I am delighted," Clement said.
"I'm aware of the positive impact he had on the side during his time on loan last season from speaking to people at the club, and also watching a number of the matches back myself.
"I feel that we're in a good place with how the squad is looking right now."
The fee for Ince, who had a year to run on his Tigers contract, eclipses the previous record of £3.5m which was paid to Norwich City for Wales striker Robert Earnshaw in 2007.
"I'm over the moon, especially after last season," Ince told 
    

BBC Radio Derby.
Ince won 21 caps for the England Under-21 side and also represented his country at U17 and U19 level
