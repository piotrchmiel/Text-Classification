MONTREAL (AP) -- David Villa scored twice to help New York City FC beat the Montreal Impact 2-1 on Saturday night.
Josh Saunders had eight saves as NYCFC (5-8-5) defeated Montreal for the second time in three weeks after winning 3-1 at Yankee Stadium on June 13.
Ignacio Piatti scored from the penalty spot for the Impact (5-7-3), who lost for the first time at Saputo Stadium since May 9.
It looked as if Montreal and NYCFC were headed for a tie after Piatti scored in the 77th minute. After New York's Thomas McNamara handled the ball in the box, Piatti earned his team-high fifth goal of the season.
But Villa curled a free kick around Montreal's wall and past goalkeeper Evan Bush for the Spanish striker's second goal in the 82nd minute.
The Impact controlled much of the game, outshooting New York 25-5.
In the 16th minute, Piatti beat Saunders from roughly 10 yards out, but Shay Facey blocked the shot. Minutes later, midfielder Dilly Duka was sent in all alone on goal, but Saunders charged out of his net and got an arm on the shot.
NYCFC jumped in front in the 34th minute. Following a failed clearance by Laurent Ciman, Villa fired home his team-leading seventh goal of the season from a tight angle.
