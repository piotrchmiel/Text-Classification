I'm Already Sexy captured $100,000 Monmouth Park feature

OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- I'm Already Sexy grabbed the lead at the top of the stretch and held off an inside charge by favorite Kenzadargent to capture the $100,000, Grade 3 Eatontown Stakes by a half-length at Monmouth Park on Saturday.
I'm Already Sexy covered a mile and a sixteenth on the turf in 1:41 1/5 in giving jockey Paco Lopez his fifth winner on the card.  The Wayne Catalano-trained mare paid $16.80, $5.60 and $4.20 in winning for the ninth time in 23 career starts.
''She is a really nice mare,'' Catalano said.  ''Paco put her in a great position early on and she had a perfect trip.  She likes to sit just off the pace and with age, she has learned to settle. She always seems to know where the wire is and just continues to battle.''
Kenzadargent returned $3.60 and $3. Staeelar Path was $3.80 to show.
Lopez also won with first-time starter Awesome Slew ($5.40) in the first race, Hop Skip and Away ($6.40) in the sixth, Lucky Bella ($12.40) in the eighth and Private Estate ($3.60) in the 10th race.
