Salutos Amigos wins featured race at Monmouth Park

OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Salutos Amigos sat off the early speed before storming home to a 3 1/4- length victory over Uptown Boy in the $75,000 Mr. Prospector Stakes at Monmouth Park on Sunday.
Ridden by Cornelio Velasquez, Salutos Amigos covered the six furlongs in 1:08 2.5. The David Jacobson-trained gelding paid $3.40, $2.80 and $2.10 in winning for the 10th time in 29 career starts.
''He sat off the quick early pace and I waited to wait a little longer than usual to ask him to go,'' Velasquez said. ''Once I did at the quarter pole, there was no hesitation. He got the lead with ease and finished strong.''
Uptown Boy returned $10.20 and $4.80.  It was another 4 1/4 lengths back to Happy My Way, who paid $2.40 for show.
