GB Packers tight end Quarless charged with firing a gun

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Green Bay Packers tight end Andrew Quarless was arrested Saturday after police said he allegedly fired two shots into the air during an argument outside a Miami Beach parking garage, authorities said.
Miami Beach Police say a witness reported that Quarless was riding in a black Porsche with three other people around 5 a.m. Saturday when they pulled up to a car full of women. An arrest affidavit says the football player and another man approached the car. It said the conversation eventually escalated and the witness told authorities he heard the women yelling for Quarless and his friend to leave them alone.
That's when authorities say Quarless, who is entering his sixth season with the Packers, pulled out a handgun and fired two shots in the air. Quarless and the driver of the Porsche fled, but were later found and the gun was recovered, the affidavit states.
He was charged with discharging a firearm in public.
Emails to Quarless' agent were not immediately returned Saturday. The team said it was aware of the incident, but declined further comment.
Quarless, who caught a game-winning touchdown pass from quarterback Aaron Rodgers in a memorable play against the Dolphins in October, started 11 games last season, catching 29 passes for 323 yards and three touchdowns.
Press-Gazette Media of Green Bay, Wisconsin, reports Quarless' arrest is the second incident for the team this week. On Thursday, defensive end Datone Jones was suspended by the NFL for the team's 2015 opener in Chicago for violating the league's substance-abuse policy.
