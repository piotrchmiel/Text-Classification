Sutter signs 5-year extension with Canucks

VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Canucks have signed recently acquired center Brandon Sutter to a five-year contract extension at an average annual value of $4.375 million (US) per season.
The Canucks acquired the 6-foot-3, 190-pound Sutter and a third-round draft pick in 2016 from the Pittsburgh Penguins on Tuesday for Nick Bonino, Adam Clendening and a 2016 second-round draft pick.
Sutter, who has a cap hit of $3.3 million (US) in 2015-16, was set to become an unrestricted free agent next summer, but is now under contract through the 2020-21 season.
The 26-year-old had 21 goals, 12 assists and 14 penalty minutes in 80 games in mostly a third-line role with Pittsburgh last season behind Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. Sutter finished with a team-leading 50.6 percent faceoff efficiency and tied for second in the NHL with four short-handed goals.
Sutter is the son of former NHL player and coach Brent Sutter.
In 495 career NHL games, Sutter has 98 goals, 87 assists and 94 penalty minutes with Pittsburgh and Carolina. He had 12 points (8 goals, 4 assists) in 33 playoff games with the Penguins.
