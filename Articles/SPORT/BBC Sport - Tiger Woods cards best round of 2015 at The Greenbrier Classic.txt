Former world number one Tiger Woods carded his best round of the year with a four-under-par 66 on the first day of The Greenbrier Classic.
It was Woods' lowest score on the PGA tour since March 2014 as he shot seven birdies in West Virginia.
The 14-time major winner has struggled for form in 2015 and is currently ranked 220th in the world.
He missed the cut in the 
    

US Open at Chambers Bay 


     with his worst score in the event.
The 39-year-old has also recorded three scores in the 80s in his last six tournaments and last month shot the 
    

worst round of his professional career 


     with a 13-over-par 85 at the Memorial Tournament in Ohio.
But on Thursday, Woods broke 70 for just the third time his year and the first time since the third round of the Masters in April.
"I felt like I wasn't that far away," said Woods. "I know people think I'm crazy for saying that, but I just felt like I wasn't that far. I just had to make a couple little tweaks, and I felt like I pulled that off."
USA's Scott Langley was clubhouse leader on eight-under with England's Brian Davis two shots of the leader on six-under.
