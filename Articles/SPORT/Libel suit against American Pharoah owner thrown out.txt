Libel suit against American Pharoah owner thrown out

NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A libel lawsuit has been dismissed against the owner of Triple Crown winner American Pharoah.
A federal judge in New Jersey filed a stipulation of dismissal Wednesday in the lawsuit brought by attorney J. Joseph Bainton.
Bainton represented a Florida man who sued Ahmed Zayat over more than $1 million he says he advanced Zayat for bets at offshore casinos. That lawsuit was thrown out by a judge in June.
Bainton claimed that Zayat's public comments about that lawsuit constituted libel.
American Pharoah became the first horse in 37 years to win the Triple Crown. Last weekend, he won the $1.75 million Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park in his first start since winning the Triple Crown.
