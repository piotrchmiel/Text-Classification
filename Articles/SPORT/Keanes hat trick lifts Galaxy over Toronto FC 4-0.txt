Keane's hat trick lifts Galaxy over Toronto FC, 4-0

CARSON, Calif. (AP) -- Robbie Keane recorded his third-career hat trick to help the Los Angeles Galaxy beat Toronto FC 4-0 on Saturday night.
Keane, who had two hat tricks in the 2013 season, opened the scoring on a penalty kick in the ninth minute.
After he buried a cross from Baggio Husidic in the 41st, Keane intercepted Justin Morrow's back pass from near midfield and slipped past goalkeeper Chris Konopka to make it 3-0 about 18 minutes later.
Sebastian Lletget's goal in extra time capped the scoring.
Brian Rowe filled in for goalkeeper Jaime Penedo, who is playing for Panama in international competition, and earned his second shutout of the season for Los Angeles (8-6-7).
The Galaxy are 5-0-5 in their last 10 league matches with Toronto (7-7-2), dating to 2008.
