Young wins Stage 4 at Tour of Utah in sprint finish

HEBER VALLEY, Utah (AP) -- Eric Young beat Dion Smith in a sprint finish to win Stage 4 of the Tour of Utah on Thursday, while Jure Kocjan finished third and took over the yellow jersey as overall leader.
The peloton pulled back an early breakaway during the 127-mile stage from Soldier Hollow, and Young's Optum team positioned him well for the uphill finish.
Kiel Reijnen had held the overall lead since Stage 1. He lost 14 seconds on the day.
Stage 5 on Friday is the familiar Salt Lake City Circuit, which takes riders on seven loops totaling 55 miles through the city. But there is additional climbing on the circuit this year that could shake up the overall standings heading into the weekend.
