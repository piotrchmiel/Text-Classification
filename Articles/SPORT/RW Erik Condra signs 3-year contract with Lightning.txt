TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Free agent right wing Erik Condra has signed a three-year contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning.
Condra appeared in 68 games with the Ottawa Senators last season, finishing with a career-high nine goals and 23 points.
In 299 career games with the Senators, who selected him in the seventh round of the 2006 NHL draft, he has 33 goals and 87 points.
The signing Wednesday reunites the 6-foot, 190-pound forward with Lightning coach Jon Cooper. Condra played for the coach while both were with the NAHL's Texarkana Bandits during the 2003-04 season.
