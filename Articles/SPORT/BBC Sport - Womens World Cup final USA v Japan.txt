Women's World Cup 2015 highlights: USA 2-0 Germany
Japan 
    

beat England 2-1 in the semi-final 


     to set up a repeat of the 2011 final, where they 
    

beat USA 3-1 on penalties 


     after it had finished 2-2.
But at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, USA won gold when they defeated Japan 2-1 in the final.
"It's a revenge match for both sides," said Japan defender Saki Kumagai.
"Compared to four years ago or even two years ago all our team members have grown. It will be a game where all of us will show how we have developed our skills."
USA are aiming to become the first country to win the World Cup three times after previous successes in 1991 and 1999.

Carli Lloyd, who missed a penalty in the 2011 World Cup final but scored both goals in the Americans' 2-1 Olympic win a year later, said: "I want to bring everything I have to this game.
"Everything is on the line and my foot is on the pedal full force. Our confidence is growing, it grew against China and Germany and now it's no regrets, full throttle.
"We know what's at stake and have to play our best. We'll be able to weather the storm, we've got fresh legs and are physically fit."
There is expected to be a crowd of more than 53,000 at the BC Place Stadium in Vancouver for the final.
