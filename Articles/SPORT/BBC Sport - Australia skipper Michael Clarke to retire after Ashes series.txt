
Australia captain Michael Clarke will retire from international cricket at the end of the current Ashes series.
The 34-year-old saw his team 
    

surrender the Ashes 


     after losing to England by an innings and 78 runs at Trent Bridge.
He averages only 16 from eight innings and Australia are 3-1 behind with one match left at The Oval on 20 August.
"I certainly don't want to jump ship and leave the boys now. I'll play the last Test, give it one last crack, but the time is right now," Clarke said.
