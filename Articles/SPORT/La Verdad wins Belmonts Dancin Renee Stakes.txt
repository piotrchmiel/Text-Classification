La Verdad wins Belmont's Dancin Renee Stakes

NEW YORK (AP) -- La Verdad flaunted her class Sunday, cruising to a 7 1/4-length victory in the $100,000 Dancin Renee Stakes for New York bred fillies and mares at Belmont Park.
It was a third straight stakes win for the 5-year-old trained by Linda Rice. The previous two victories were graded handicaps: the Distaff at Aqueduct and the Vagrancy at Belmont.
The Dancing Renee, a restricted race, was a much softer spot and La Verdad responded accordingly. Once Jose Ortiz got her out of the starting gate cleanly, the outcome was never in doubt.
La Verdad dictated the pace, opening a four-length lead after a half mile. The margin widened to 6 1/2 lengths at the top of the stretch.
The 1-10 favorite rolled home to her 13th win in 19 starts, lifting her career earnings to $1.05 million. La Verdad is now 6 for 7 at Belmont.
Rice said the race was a perfect prep for the $200,000 Honorable Miss Stakes on July 29 at Saratoga.
''I'm really glad we're going to Saratoga off an easy effort,'' Rice said.
The time was 1:10.27 on the sloppy track.
La Verdad paid $2.20 and $2.10.
Make the Moment rallied to get second, returning $4.60.
Miss Da Point was third.
There was no show wagering.
