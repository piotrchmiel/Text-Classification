FRISCO, Texas (AP) -- Mauro Diaz had an early goal and a late assist, helping FC Dallas beat the New England Revolution 3-0 on Saturday night.
Diaz also played a role in the second goal for FC Dallas (8-5-5) in the 64th minute, pressuring Revolution defender Jose Goncalves to create a deep giveaway. Diaz crossed it back to Fabian Castillo for a shot from the middle of the box. Bobby Shuttleworth made the save, but Scott Caldwell's clearance attempt ricocheted off teammate Jeremy Hall and back to Castillo, who finished the second chance.
Diaz opened the scoring in the ninth minute, slipping a free kick under New England's defensive wall of five players who all jumped in unison.
In the 73rd, Diaz split the central defense with a pass to Michael Barrios, who scored his first career MLS goal.
The Revolution (6-8-6) have lost four in a row.
