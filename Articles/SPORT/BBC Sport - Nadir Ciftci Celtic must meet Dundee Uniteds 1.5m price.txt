
Nadir Ciftci's agent says the Turkish striker would consider a move to Celtic, but they would need to meet Dundee United's £1.5m asking price.
The 23-year-old has already 
    

rejected a move to Wigan Athletic, 


     who had a bid of more than £1m accepted by United.
And agent Pierre van Hooijdonk told BBC Scotland: "There are only two offers on the table at the moment from two clubs.
"He told Wigan he does not want to go there. If United accept an offer from Celtic, we could talk."
Celtic have already had two offers of £900,000 and £1m rejected for the player who joined United from Breda in 2013.
However, former Celtic and Netherlands striker Van Hooijdonk insists that Ciftci is happy working under United manager Jackie McNamara.
"We don't want to put the player in a situation that he doesn't want to be in," he said. "He is not desperate to go.
