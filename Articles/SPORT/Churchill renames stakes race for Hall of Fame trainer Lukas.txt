The $175,000 Lukas Classic for 3-year-olds and up on dirt on Sept. 26 will wind down the upcoming 11-date meet at the track he has won the marquee Kentucky Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies four times each.
Lukas will turn 80 on Sept. 2. His stables are based in Barn 44 at Churchill, where the four-time Eclipse Award winner ranks second with 73 stakes wins and fourth with 510 victories overall.
