Astros' Springer headed to 15-day DL with broken right wrist

HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros outfielder George Springer has been placed on the 15-day disabled list with a broken right wrist.
Springer was injured when he was hit on the wrist by a 95 mph fastball thrown by Edinson Volquez in the fifth inning of Houston's win over Kansas City on Wednesday night.
It's a blow for the first-place Astros, who count Springer as their best outfielder for dazzling defense play and power on offense where he is hitting .264 with 13 homers and 29 RBIs. A first-round pick in 2011, Springer injured his quadriceps last July and missed the rest of the season.
Springer also had 14 doubles and 14 stolen bases this season for the Astros, who have the most wins in the American League at 47-34.
Outfielder Alex Presley was called up from Triple-A Fresno to take his spot on the roster.
