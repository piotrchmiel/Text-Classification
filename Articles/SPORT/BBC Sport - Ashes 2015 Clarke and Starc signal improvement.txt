Essex 414
Essex trail Australia by 360 runs
Scorecard
Australia captain Michael Clarke and pace bowler Mitchell Starc showed some form before the Ashes but the tourists did not have things all their own way on day three against Essex.
Clarke, who got a golden duck in the first innings, hit 77, during which he took a painful blow on the hand.
His effort was the mainstay of an Australia second innings that faltered to 212-8, a lead of 360.
Earlier Starc added four more wickets to finish with 6-51 as Essex made 414.
Australia will expect to complete victory on the final day, especially with the pitch showing signs of uneven bounce and the hosts being without injured batsmen Nick Browne and Tom Westley.
But the tourists have not dominated this match in the way they might, given that Essex allowed them to bat at the toss, fielded four bowlers who had played only 28 previous first-class matches between them and have dropped a total of 10 catches.
