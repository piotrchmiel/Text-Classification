BBC Sport - Zak Hardaker: Leeds Rhinos full-back signs new contract

Leeds Rhinos full-back Zak Hardaker has signed a new four-year deal with the Super League leaders.
The 23-year-old has made 124 appearances for the Headingley side since 
    
joining from Featherstone Rovers.
In April he agreed to 
    
attend anger management classes 

     and do volunteer work after an assault on a student.
Coach Brian McDermott said: "I'm really pleased that Zak has agreed this new contract and committed his future to the club and our competition."
Hardaker was fined and warned by Leeds for breaching their code of conduct after being thrown out of England's World Cup squad in 2013 for misconduct.
He also served a five-match ban in June 2014 after being found guilty of making homophobic comments during a game against Warrington.
He added: "Zak has had some well-publicised ups and downs in his career but there is no doubting his ability on the field.
"His work ethic and commitment on and off the field this season cannot be questioned and I think over the next few years he will mature into a world-class player."
The England international has won two Grand Finals, a World Club Challenge and a Challenge Cup with the Rhinos.
