Offensive tackle Hunter attempts to revive career with Bills

ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Bills are providing offensive tackle Wayne Hunter an opportunity to revive his career.
Hunter signed with the Bills on Wednesday. The 6-foot-5 and 318-pound Hunter has been out of football since being released by St. Louis following the 2012 season.
He has 25 starts in 77 games, including a four-year stint with the Jets that overlapped Bills new coach Rex Ryan's tenure in New York.
Drafted in the third round by Seattle in 2003, Hunter has had off-field run-ins with the law.
He was released by the Seahawks in May 2006 after being charged with misdemeanor assault following a dispute at a sports bar. Hunter was also arrested in 2003 for a minor assault against his girlfriend, and was twice suspended for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy.
Hunter joins a team that is giving offensive guard Richie Incognito a second chance. Incognito signed with Buffalo in January after being out of football for 18 months for his involvement in the Miami Dolphins' bullying scandal.
