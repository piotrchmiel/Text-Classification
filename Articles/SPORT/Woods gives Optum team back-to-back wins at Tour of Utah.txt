Woods gives Optum team back-to-back wins at Tour of Utah

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Mike Woods gave his Optum team back-to-back wins at the Tour of Utah on Friday, pulling away from the field on the uphill finish of Stage 5 to capture the yellow jersey.
The breakaway was swept up on the last of seven circuits in Salt Lake city, and Woods was sitting fifth wheel as the field headed toward the finish. He survived the tough finishing kick after Kiel Reijnen and Jure Kocjan went too soon in their final sprint.
Sonny Colbrelli finished second and Reijnen crossed in third, and the shakeup allowed Brent Bookwalter to move into second in the overall standings with Kocjan in third.
Those standings could change again Saturday with the queen stage, a 110-mile trek to Snowbird that features four categorized climbs.
