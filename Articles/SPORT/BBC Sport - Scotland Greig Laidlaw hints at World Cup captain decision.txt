BBC Sport - Scotland: Greig Laidlaw hints at World Cup captain decision

Greig Laidlaw has hinted that a decision may already have been made on Scotland's World Cup captaincy.
The Gloucester scrum-half led Vern Cotter's team during the autumn Tests and this year's Six Nations campaign.
"I have spoken to Vern [about the captaincy] and a couple of other things," Laidlaw revealed.
"I respect Vern and he respects me, and the players respect me as well. Whether I am captain or not, I will still be the same player and the same person."
The captaincy issue aside, 29-year-old Laidlaw faces competition for the number nine jersey from highly-rated Edinburgh youngster, Sam Hidalgo-Clyne, and Henry Pyrgos, who helped Glasgow Warriors to the Pro12 title.
"Boys are used to competition these days, it is part of the game and it is part of professional rugby," he told BBC Scotland.
"It is good to see where you are up against other players in the squad and push yourself to try and get out in front.
"I think I have been playing well also. I played well in the Premiership for Gloucester, I won the Challenge Cup in my first season. I am only 29 and I still have a hell of a lot to give to the Scotland jersey."
