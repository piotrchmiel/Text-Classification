BBC Sport - Charlie Austin: QPR reject Leicester's £12m bid for striker

Queens Park Rangers have turned down a £12m bid from Leicester for striker Charlie Austin.
The 25-year-old, who still has a year left on his contract, scored 18 Premier League goals last season as 
    
QPR were relegated 

     to the Championship.
The former Burnley and Swindon Town man was 
    
called up by England 

     for the first time last month for the games against Slovenia and the Republic of Ireland.
It is understood QPR want at least £15m for the player.
Newcastle 

     and 
    
Crystal Palace  

     have already been heavily linked with Austin, who finished fourth in the Premier League scoring charts last season with almost half of his club's entire total of 42.
Leicester have sanctioned the bid, which would have been a club-record fee for Austin, 
    
after sacking manager Nigel Pearson 

     on Tuesday.
