Awesome England deserve win - Mark Sampson
England beat Germany 4-2 in the 1966 final at Wembley after Geoff Hurst's hat-trick, and Sampson said his team had achieved similar moments as they secured a bronze medal - their most successful World Cup finish.
By beating European champions Germany 1-0 - thanks to Fara Williams's extra-time penalty - they finished as the highest-ranked European nation in Canada, and ended a winless record against the world's number one team that had spanned 20 matches and 31 years.
"It's special to be talked about even in the same breath as the team from 1966," added Sampson. "There are moments from that tournament back in '66, the Hurst hat-trick, the Bobby Moore tackle, and the players will remembered forever for some of the moments in this tournament.
