O'Reilly signs 7-year extension with Sabres

The Buffalo Sabres signed newly acquired forward Ryan O'Reilly to a seven-year contract extension on Friday.
The team announced the deal with O'Reilly, who was scheduled to make $6.2 million next season.
O'Reilly is regarded a top-line talent and had one year left on his contract. He was acquired from Colorado in a trade that involved five players during the first round of the NHL draft June 26.
The Sabres also acquired forward Jamie McGinn, while giving up forward Mikhail Grigorenko, JT Compher, defenseman Nikita Zadorov and the 31st pick of the draft.
O'Reilly will get a chance to play alongside rookie center Jack Eichel, who was selected with the second pick in the draft. O'Reilly had 17 goals and 55 points in 80 games last season. He also led Avalanche forwards in averaging nearly 20 minutes of ice time.
The sixth-year player has 90 goals and 246 points in 427 career games.
