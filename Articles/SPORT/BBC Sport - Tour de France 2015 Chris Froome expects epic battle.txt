Britain's Chris Froome expects an "epic battle" at this year's Tour de France, which begins in Utrecht on Saturday.
There are six summit finishes to test the riders in the 21-stage race which climaxes in Paris on Sunday, 26 July.
Froome, the 2013 winner, faces Italy's defending champion Vincenzo Nibali, Spain's two-time winner Alberto Contador and Colombia's Nairo Quintana.
He said: "The way the Tour's structured this year it is going to be the biggest battle we've seen for years."
In short, the four best riders in the world - Froome, Nibali, Contador and Quintana - are racing over one of the most mountainous routes in years. Throw into the mix 194 other riders, a nervy opening week that features an individual time trial, cobbled roads, crosswinds, short, sharp climbs and a team time trial and you have all the ingredients for a classic race.
But do not take our word for it. Britain's Geraint Thomas, who is part of Team Sky's nine-man squad and will be helping Froome, told BBC Sport that stage two, which will largely be raced along the Belgian coast with the threat of crosswinds will "probably be the most stressful day of the whole year's racing".
Froome was forced to abandon last year's race after 
    

fracturing his left wrist and right hand 


     in falls during week one.
The 30-year-old said: "That first week is going to be crucial, the first nine days actually until we get up in the mountains on stage 10.
