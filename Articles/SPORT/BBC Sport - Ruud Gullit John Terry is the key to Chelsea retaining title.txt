BBC Sport - Ruud Gullit: John Terry is the key to Chelsea retaining title

I am looking forward to being back on Match of the Day this season because the Premier League is the most exciting league to watch, and also very difficult to win.
I love to see attacking football but a great defence is always the foundation for success, which is why I think Chelsea will retain their title because they have got the best defender in the world in John Terry.
Terry is 34 but he is the heart of their team and whoever is alongside him at the back always plays well. They learn a lot from him and his experience, and that is why Chelsea are so solid.
Terry played every minute of Chelsea's 38 Premier League games last season
