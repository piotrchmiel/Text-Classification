ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A person with knowledge of the details says Tobias Harris has agreed to sign a new contract to remain with the Orlando Magic.
The person says the deal for Harris - a restricted free agent - is for four years and $64 million. The person spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because contract can't be officially signed until next week.
The 22-year-old forward completed his fourth NBA season and second full year in Orlando after coming over in a trade with Milwaukee in 2013. He averaged a career-high 17.1 points last season, while also shooting a career-best 36 percent from the 3-point line.
The move keeps intact a young Magic team that features eight players under age 25.
