Graeme McDowell's hopes of winning a third successive French Open title ended as he carded a seven-over-par 78 to miss the cut.
McDowell, 35, was unable to finish his first round on Thursday because of weather delays and, when play resumed, he parred the 18th for an opening 72.
But he ran up two double bogeys in his second round to finish eight over.
France's Victor Dubuisson is tied for the lead on four under with Spain's Rafael Cabrera-Bello and Martin Kaymer.
Five players are in second place on three under - English trio Tyrrell Hatton, James Morrison and Daniel Brooks, plus South Africa's Jaco van Zyl and Italy's Francesco Molinari.
Italian teenager Renato Paratore had one of the most noteworthy rounds, the French teenager becoming the first player in the 43-year history of the European Tour to record the same score - a four - on each hole.
McDowell's second round was his worst score in 32 rounds at Le Golf National in Paris.
The Northern Irishman has recorded just one top-10 finish on the European Tour this season, a tie for ninth in the Dubai Desert Classic in February.
"I struggled to get in the fairway and, as firm and as fast as this course is, if you're not hitting the fairway you have a bit of a problem getting close to the flag," he said.
"It is very disappointing. This course has been so good to me over the years, just not to be this year. I will keep grinding and it is a big summer ahead."
