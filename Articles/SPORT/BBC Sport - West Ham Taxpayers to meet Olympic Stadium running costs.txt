
West Ham United will have many of the running costs met by the taxpayer when they move to the £700m Olympic Stadium next year, the BBC has learnt.
Critics say it means the Premier League club will get their new home virtually rent free.
West Ham won the bid 


     to occupy the stadium, which was built for the London 2012 Olympics, and are expected to move from their Upton Park ground in August 2016.
The public authority that owns the stadium, the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), has revealed some details of its rental agreement with the club in response to a 
    

Freedom of Information request.
Much of the contract between LLDC and West Ham, which has been seen by the BBC, is redacted.
But it does show that a large number of "facilities and services" will be paid for by the grantor - ie the taxpayer - and not the club.
These include the cost of stadium utilities, security, maintaining the pitch, and even the goalposts and corner flags.
The BBC understands other overheads that could also be paid by the LLDC include the cost of stewarding and policing on match days, which amounts to many hundreds of thousands of pounds for other Premier League clubs.
Two separate football business experts told the BBC the value of the services amounts to between £1.4m and £2.5m a year.
West Ham, who received more than £76m in prize money for finishing 12th in the Premier League last season, are understood to be paying approximately £2m to £2.5m a year in rent.
Manchester City pay all their overheads on top of £4m rent a year at their former Commonwealth Games venue
