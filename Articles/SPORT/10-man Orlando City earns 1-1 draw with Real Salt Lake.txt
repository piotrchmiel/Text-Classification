10-man Orlando City earns 1-1 draw with Real Salt Lake

SANDY, Utah (AP) -- Kaka was sent off in the 45th minute, but 10-man Orlando City held Real Salt Lake scoreless for the second half to earn a 1-1 draw on Saturday night.
Orlando City (6-6-6) took the lead in the fifth minute on Kaka's ninth goal of the season. He got behind the defense on Pedro Ribeiro's feed and slotted home the right-footed shot.
Kaka received the red card after knocking RSL's Javier Morales to the ground and stepping on him as his momentum carried him past. Referee Sorin Stoica ruled it was a stomp.
Sebastian Jaime tied it for Real Salt Lake (5-6-8) in the 28th minute with a header from the middle of the box. It was the designated player's third goal in four matches after going scoreless for his first 11 MLS appearances.
