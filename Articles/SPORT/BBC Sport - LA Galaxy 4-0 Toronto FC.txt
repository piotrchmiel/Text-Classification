BBC Sport - LA Galaxy 4-0 Toronto FC

New LA Galaxy signing Steven Gerrard was introduced to the crowd at half-time against Toronto as Robbie Keane scored a hat-trick in a 4-0 win.
Former England captain Gerrard, 35, will be eligible to make his Major League Soccer debut following his 
    

move from Liverpool on 18 July.
Gerrard said: "I can't wait to get my boots on and play in front of you guys.
"I've been in Liverpool all my life. But this is a good place for me to come... and hopefully add a trophy."
Gerrard's debut could come in two weeks' time against San Jose Earthquakes (04:00 BST, 18 July).
On the pitch, it was his former Liverpool team-mate Keane who was the star of the day though.
