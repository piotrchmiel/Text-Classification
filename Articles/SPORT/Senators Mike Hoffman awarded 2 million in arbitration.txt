Senators' Mike Hoffman awarded $2 million in arbitration

OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) -- Ottawa Senators forward Mike Hoffman has been awarded a $2 million, one-year contract by an arbitrator.
Hoffman asked for $3.4 million and the Senators sought $1.75 million. Hoffman's hearing was Thursday but the ruling was delayed until Monday because of the extended weekend in Ontario.
Hoffman is set to be a restricted free agent again next summer.
The 25-year-old player finished sixth in Calder Trophy voting for NHL rookie of the year with 27 goals and 21 assists.
