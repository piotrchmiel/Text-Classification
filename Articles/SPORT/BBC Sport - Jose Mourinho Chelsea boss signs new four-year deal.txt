
Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has signed a new four-year deal at the Stamford Bridge club.
The new deal will keep the 52-year-old in his post until at least 2019.
The Portuguese, who had previously been in charge from 2004-2007, rejoined in 2013 on a four-year deal, leading the Blues to the Premier League title and the Capital One Cup last season.

Jose Mourinho predicts 'stronger' league
"I said when I returned here that I have a special feeling for this club and nothing changed," he said.
"I think this is a normal thing for me to sign a new contract. It is important we have this continuity and I hope we can enjoy more success in the future - for the fans, the players and the club.
"It is the club closest to my heart and I am very happy to know I will be staying here for a long time."
Mourinho has the best win rate (69%) of any manager to have taken charge of 15 or more Premier League games and will lead his side out in their season opener against Swansea on Saturday at 17:30 BST.
Last season, Chelsea were the only club in all four divisions to remain unbeaten at home, winning the title with three matches to spare.

    "He's the best manager. He makes up points. If Mourinho was in charge of any of the top four, I would put them favourites to win the title."
