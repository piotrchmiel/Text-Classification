Daring Kathy wins Belmont's Perfect Sting Stakes

NEW YORK (AP) -- Daring Kathy held on by a nose Friday to win the $100,000 Perfect Sting Stakes for fillies and mares on the turf at Belmont Park.
The 4-year-old extended her winning streak to three with a pacesetting effort in her season debut. Marbre Rose, the 3-1 favorite, came charging through but could not nudge past the leader.
Daring Kathy paid $13.60, $7.30 and $4.20 for the 5-1 upset, her seventh win in 10 starts. Javier Castellano was aboard for trainer Chad Brown as she ran the mile in 1:33.85 over the firm course.
Marbre Rose returned $4.40 and $3, while Photo Call paid $4.20 to show.
