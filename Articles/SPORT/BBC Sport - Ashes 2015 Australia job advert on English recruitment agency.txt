
Just when you thought Australia's cricket team could be mocked no more.
On Thursday, the likes of 
    

Crimestoppers and Nottinghamshire Police 


     had the tourists in their sights as they were dismissed for just 60 in the fourth Ashes Test.
Now one UK recruitment agency has 
    

invited applications for positions in the Australian XIÂ  


     "due to current underperforming talent".
But a very specific criteria exists, as the advert specifies the successful candidate will have "perfected the art of sledging" and "have a big ego".

Other requirements, as per the job description:
The recruitment firm appears to also be calling on Kevin Pietersen to move on from his 104-Test career for England.
The advert continues: "Please note: We are particularly interested in hearing from talented South Africans with strong Test experience (100+) with outstanding natural ability."
Should you wish to carry a nation's "slim hopes", as the agency puts it, why not draft a CV? That summer you spent bowling a ball at a wall in the back garden was always going to help one day, wasn't it?
Send your application soon - at the time of writing, Australia are 
more than 200 runs behind in their second innings of the fourth Test.
 A fightback could see the opening disappear, but defeat and a 3-1 series deficit with one to play should improve your chances.
That, of course, is if this advert is not a spoof...
