Wawrinka, the Swiss fourth seed, beat Spain's Fernando Verdasco 6-4 6-3 6-4 and faces Belgian 16th seed David Goffin next.
Djokovic has reached the second week of Wimbledon for the seventh year running by winning all nine sets he has contested.
As he left the court, he was inundated with requests for autographs - including one more unusual one.
"This gentleman gave me his artificial leg and I hope my signature will make him feel good," he said.
"It has been great so far. I was hoping I could play better and better as the tournament progresses and that is what is happening. As we are moving on, I feel more confident.
"My serve was very good today. I won a lot of free points and that takes away a lot of pressure. Maybe it looks like I haven't been tested but I have. I have played a couple of good players. It will get harder."
Stan Wawrinka has won the Australian Open and the French Open during his career
