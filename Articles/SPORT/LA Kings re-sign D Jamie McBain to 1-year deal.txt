LA Kings re-sign D Jamie McBain to 1-year deal

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Defenseman Jamie McBain has agreed to a one-year deal to return to the Los Angeles Kings.
The Kings announced the deal Friday.
McBain scored nine points in 26 games for the Kings last season. He began the year on a tryout contract with the Kings' AHL affiliate, but worked his way into a semi-regular role in Los Angeles when the Kings' defense was shortened by injuries and Slava Voynov's suspension.
McBain has scored 28 goals in 301 NHL games, starting his career with Carolina and Buffalo.
