Defending champion Petra Kvitova suffered a shock early Wimbledon exit as former world number one Jelena Jankovic fought back to secure a third-round victory.
Jankovic, the 28th seed, beat the Czech world number two 3-6 7-5 6-4.
It marked the first time since 2009 that two-time Wimbledon winner Kvitova, 25, has failed to make at least the quarter-finals at the All England Club.
Jankovic, 30, will face 2012 finalist Agnieszka Radwanska in the last 16.
Jelena Jankovic's best Grand Slam singles run to date was reaching the 2008 US Open final
