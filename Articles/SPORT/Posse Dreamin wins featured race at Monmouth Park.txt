Posse Dreamin wins featured race at Monmouth Park

OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Posse Dreamin charged down the center of the stretch to beat favored Pool Winner by a neck Friday in the $40,000 allowance claiming feature at Monmouth Park.
Owned and trained by Edwin Broome, Posse Dreamin ran five furlongs over the turf course in 55 3/5. The 3-year-old gelding paid $34.60, $11.20, and $4.80 in winning for the third time in 12 career starts.
Pool Winner returned $2.60 and $2.10. Dedicated to Bob finished third and paid $2.80 to show.
''We got bumped a little at the start, but we were sitting all right just behind the leader,'' jockey Wilmer Garcia said. ''I knew he had to get going at the three-eighths pole. I just wanted to guide him into a good spot going into the stretch.''
