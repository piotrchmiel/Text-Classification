SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Takeover Target surged past A Lot on the outside and won the Grade 2 $200,000 National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame Stakes by a half-lentgth Friday at Saratoga Race Course.
Ridden by Irad Ortiz Jr. for trainer Chad Brown, Takeover Target ran 1 1/16 miles in 1:42 over a firm turf course. A Lot held for second, a half-length ahead of 12-1 long-shot Courtier. A Lot and Courtier are trained by Hall of Famer Bill Mott.
It was the first stakes victory for Takeover Target, one of four in an 11-horse field trained by Brown. In his last start, the 3-year-old Harlan's Holiday colt finished fifth in the Grade 1 Belmont Derby on July 4.
Takeover Target paid $10.40, $5.20 and $4.50 for his third win in five lifetime starts. A Lot returned $5.80 and $4.50, and Courtier paid $8.30 to show.
