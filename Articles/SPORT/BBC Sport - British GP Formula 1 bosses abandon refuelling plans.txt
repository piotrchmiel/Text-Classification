Formula 1 bosses have decided to abandon plans to reintroduce refuelling from 2017.
The idea was proposed in May but investigations revealed it would lead to a drop in on-track overtaking and too little variation in strategies.
It was dropped at a meeting of the strategy group of leading teams and officials on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone is pushing to impose an engine freeze in a bid to make racing more competitive.
The 84-year-old's proposal is to impose an upper limit on the performance of engines and allow manufacturers who are not yet at that level to develop until they meet it.
The idea is to give Renault and Honda, who are lagging behind at the moment, the chance to catch up with Mercedes and Ferrari.
Mercedes are pushing against the idea.
These were just two of the issues to emerge from the strategy group meeting on Wednesday at which bosses have agreed to reduce driver aids so the role of the driver is enhanced in F1.
