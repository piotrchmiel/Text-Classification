Ten-year-old Alzain Tareq from Bahrain became the youngest swimmer to compete at a World Championships when she took part in the 50m butterfly heats.
Tareq, whose mother is Scottish, finished last in 41.13 seconds, the slowest of all 64 swimmers in Kazan.
Her goal is to qualify for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
"I was a bit nervous walking out there, I have never swum in front of so many spectators," said Tareq, who got a photo with her idol 
    

Sarah Sjostrom.
"The other swimmers are often surprised, they ask me my name and how old I am and then they are like, 'Are you swimming here?'
"I feel so happy. I want to learn the techniques and how they swim."
Tareq started swimming at the age of four and trains five days a week in Bahrain
