The world number 11 will meet American Varvara Lepchenko in the semi-finals on Saturday while Ukraine's Elina Svitolina will play Germany's Angelique Kerber at the tournament in Stanford.
Lepchenko defeated Mona Barthel of Germany 6-7 6-2 6-3 while Svitolina advanced with a 4-6 7-5 6-1 win over American Alison Riske.
