BBC Sport - British Grand Prix: Formula 1's great British heroes

How do you define a hero?
A person who is brave and courageous? Someone who can boast outstanding achievements or who displays noble qualities? Maybe a mixture of all those characteristics.
If so, Formula 1 is packed with personalities who could be described as heroes. And it feels - this weekend more than ever - like Britain has the Lion's share.

Successful on the circuit, a pioneer off it, 
        Sir Jackie Stewart

     is undoubtedly one of Formula 1's great British heroes.
The Scot won 27 races and three world championships during his eight-year career in racing and also worked tirelessly to improve F1 safety. He was the first driver to wear seatbelts, who insisted circuits should be lined by barriers and who pushed for fire-resistant clothing, pit walls, six-point safety harnesses and crash structures in cars.
