BBC Sport - Mohamed Salah: Fiorentina could take legal action

Fiorentina could take legal action after claiming Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah has refused to return to the Serie A club for a second loan spell.
Salah, 23, moved in January to the Italian club, 

     who said at the time the loan could be extended by another year.
But a 
    
Fiorentina statement now claims  

     the Egypt winger wants to join another club, rejected an improved contract and refused to attend pre-season training.
"We have placed the matter in the hands of our lawyers," the club said.
Salah scored nine goals in 26 appearances for the Viola.
He joined Chelsea from Basel for about £11m a year earlier but made only 19 appearances and six league starts.
Salah's move to Fiorentina in January came with fellow winger Juan Cuadrado moving the other way for £23.3m.
Fiorentina's press release said: "The loan agreement runs until 30 June 2015 with the possibility of extending the deal for the 2015/16 season and a further option of making the transfer permanent."
