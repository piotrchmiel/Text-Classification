Scorecard
England regained the Ashes after wrapping up a spectacular victory over Australia on the third morning of the fourth Test at Trent Bridge.
The hosts took Australia's three remaining second-innings wickets in 39 minutes of play to win by an innings and 78 runs, with Ben Stokes taking 6-36.
England's second successive three-day victory over their oldest rivals gives them an unassailable 3-1 lead in the series with one match to play.
The margin of victory is all the more remarkable given it is only 19 months since England were on the receiving end of a 5-0 thrashing by the Australians down under.
England have now beaten Australia in four consecutive home series - their best sequence since 1896.
After skittling out Australia for 60 runs on day one, England made 391-9 declared before reducing the tourists to 241-7 at the end of day two.
Stokes, whose five-wicket haul on Friday afternoon had taken England to the brink of glory, picked up where he left off with a wicket in his second over of the day as Mitchell Starc nicked a ball shaping away from him to Ian Bell at second slip.
Josh Hazlewood survived nine balls, but barely saw his 10th as a Mark Wood yorker uprooted his middle stump.
And Wood delivered the final blow as he shot one through Nathan Lyon's defences to shatter the stumps and bring Australia's last remaining batsman to his knees.
The Durham bowler was mobbed by his ecstatic team-mates, who celebrated in a huddle before embarking on a lap of honour with the sounds of "Rule, Britannia" and "Land of Hope and Glory" ringing in their ears.
