BBC Sport - Bridgestone Invitational: Graeme McDowell makes solid start

-5 D Lee (NZ); -4 G McDowell (NI), J Furyk (US);  -3 J Rose (Eng), R Fowler (US). Selected others: -2 P Casey (Eng), L Westwood (Eng), I Poulter (Eng); E J Spieth (US).
Graeme McDowell shot a four-under 66 to sit one stroke behind leader Danny Lee after the first round of the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational in Ohio.
The Northern Irishman has struggled for form this season, managing just one top-10 finish - ninth at February's Dubai Desert Classic.
But the 36-year-old carded five birdies in his opening round to sit alongside American Jim Furyk.
New Zealander Lee shot seven birdies and two bogeys for a five under 65.
Former US Open champion McDowell started the year ranked 20th in the world but has now slipped to 60th.
"It's been a rough year, no doubt about it," he said.
Jordan Spieth will become the world number one with victory on Sunday
