UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) -- Australian rider Rohan Dennis defends the yellow jersey as riders set off on the second stage of the Tour de France on Sunday.
Stage 2 left from the cycling-mad Dutch city of Utrecht, where Dennis won Saturday's individual time trial in a record average speed of 55.446 kph (34.4 mph) to become the seventh Australian rider to wear the famed leader's jersey.
The flat stage favors sprinters and ends 166 kilometers (103 miles) later at the heart of the Zeeland Delta.
However, cycling along the Dutch coastline promises to be tricky for riders, with heavy gusts, sprays and even forecasts for thunderstorms late in the afternoon.
Defending Tour champion Vincenzo Nibali gained some time on his rivals Chris Froome, Alberto Contador and Nairo Quintana in the opening stage.
